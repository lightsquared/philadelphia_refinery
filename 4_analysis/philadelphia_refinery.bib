abstract = {The current CCPS/TNO's BLEVE (Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapor Explosion) overpressure methodology is largely derived from that published by Baker in 1975{\textless}sup{\textgreater}[1]{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}. This methodology calculates the explosion energy using an isentropic expansion assumption and Baker's graphical method. The overpressure is determined graphically assuming similarity between BLEVEs and high-explosives. Baker's work was based on limited data on vapor-filled vessels and the accuracy of his method for BLEVE overpressure calculations was not tested against experimental data due to the lack of data available. Many experimental studies on BLEVE overpressure (Giesbrecht{\textless}sup{\textgreater}[2]{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, Birk {\textless}sup{\textgreater}[3-5]{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, Bulke{\textless}sup{\textgreater}[6]{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, etc.) have been published since the early 80's. We have carried out a comprehensive review and found over 100 experimental data points from the existing literature. Based on a comparison of overpressure calculations to the literature data, we found that the CCPS/TNO's method over-predicts BLEVE side-on overpressures in the range of typical industrial application (1{\textless}R{\textless}10, and 1{\textless}P{\textless}inf{\textgreater}so{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}{\textless}100kpa), especially in the near field (R{\textless}4). We also found that for liquid-full vessels, the current method underestimates the overpressure in certain regions. Starting with Baker's algorithm, a new, more accurate methodology for BLEVE over-pressure prediction was developed. Based on recent developments in the literature, adiabatic irreversible expansion was assumed in calculating explosion energies. Baker's correlation was adjusted with new multipliers derived to ensure that no experimental overpressures are under-predicted. Different sets of multipliers were determined for both BLEVE and liquid-full cases. Overall, the new method is 10-50{\%} less conservative than the CCPS/TNO's method.},

@article{Planas-Cuchi2004,
abstract = {Although a certain number of authors have analyzed the prediction of boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion (BLEVE) and fireball effects, only very few of them have proposed methodologies for predicting the overpressure from such explosions. In this paper, the methods previously published are discussed and shown to introduce a significant overestimation due to the erroneous thermodynamic assumptions - ideal gas behaviour and isentropic vapour expansion - on which they are based (in fact, they give the maximum value of overpressure which can be caused by a BLEVE). A new approach is proposed, based on the - more realistic - assumption of an adiabatic and irreversible expansion process; the real properties of the substance involved in the explosion are used. The two methods are compared through the application to a given case. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
