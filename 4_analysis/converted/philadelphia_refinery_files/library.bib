abstract = {The blast wave from the detonation of a spherical charge of TNT is described based on results of a numerical calculation. The equations of motion and the equations of state for TNT and for air are described. The pressures, densities, temperatures, and velocities are detailed as functions of time and radius. Space‐time relations and energy and impulse histories are shown. A second shock is seen to originate as an imploding shock following the inward rarefaction into the explosion product gases and a series of subsequent minor shocks are seen to appear in a similar manner, moving out in the negative phase behind the main shock.},

abstract = {Sensitivity tests are often used to estimate the parameters associated with latent continuous variables that cannot be measured. For example, each explosive specimen has a threshold. The specimen will detonate if and only if an applied shock exceeds this value. Since there is no way to determine the threshold of an individual, specimens are tested at various levels to determine parameters of the population. A new test described here produces efficient estimates of the parameters of the distribution, even with limited prior knowledge. This test efficiently characterizes the entire distribution and desired percentiles of any population.},

During the last 20 years, great advances have been made in our knowledge and understanding of blast effects phenomena. During the same period, design and construction technology have changed significantly. Eodern residential and commercial structures are much lighter and more flexible than the structures on which present IBD criteria are based. In this paper, the development of IBD criteria is reviewed, and its applicability to modern construction is evaluated. Particular attention is paid to an evaluation of probable damage and risk to modern residential structures and lightweight commercial structures, such as pre-engineered buildings, sited at IBD distances. 1.0},

abstract = {Five copper cylinder tests were performed with the insensitive explosive formu-lation PBX 9502. The tests spanned a range of sizes corresponding to scales of 0.25, 0.50, and 2.00 relative to the conventional 25.4-mm-inner-diameter test. This scale variation al-lows evaluation of effect of charge scale on the energy release in insensitive explosives, which have longer reaction zone lengths than conventional high explosives. Wall velocity histories allow measurement of the work available from the detonation products and ul-timately support product equation-of-state development. We report the raw wall velocity history records, fit analytical forms to this data, and calculate the Gurney and kinetic-energy history associated with the cylinder wall during expansion.},
annote = {Genral Subject: Cylinder Test

Specific Subject: VOD and Cylinder Test of PBX9502

Hypothesis: Non-ideal explosives will not properly scale as the cylinder scale is increased or decreased.

Methodology: Time of arrival (VOD), PDV, shadowgraph

Results: - VOD data was generally consistent with similar tests with PBX9502
-Confined charges of PBX9502 had higher VOD than unconfined. In instances where they did not it is hypotheized that it was due to air-gaps between the charge and the cylinder wall.
-Shadowgraphs showed an initial concave-out profile during the high-acceleration-phase. After about 10-20 mm along the cylinder axis the curvature decreased.
-PDV showed initial ringing of the shockwave/rarefaction wave inside the cylinder wall combined with a steady acceleration until a asymptote of steady state wall velocity.
-Failure of the cylinder wall wil visible on the PDV as a diffuse area around the the steady state velocity.
-The 0.25 scale cylinder showed a significant, 12{\%} drop, in wall veloity compared to the 0.5 and 2.0 scale cylinders. This is consistent with, although not to the same scale, VOD data. However, the comparison to VOD was not make explicitely in the paper.
-Gurney also did not scale with the cylinder scale.

Context: Shows that in addition to VOD the Gurney Energy and wall velocity do not scale with cylinder scale.

Significance: Minimal significance. Does provide good references for cylinder tests.

Important Figures: Fig 9.

abstract = {The geometry of an explosive is known to have a fundamental effect on the resulting shock wave propagation. Typically researchers use a spherical or hemispherical geometry in order to simplify the shock wave so that resultant overpressure and impulse are uniform in all directions. The goal of this research is to understand the overpressure characteristics from a sheet explosive, a geometry often utilized for breeching in the military. In training alone, soldiers can be exposed to several tests per day, which may be contributing to the prevalence of blast induced mild traumatic brain injuries. Using PCB pressure transducers and high speed video, it was found that as the angle departed from normal (perpendicular) to the face of the sheet explosive, the over pressure decreased significantly. When in line with the plane, a decrease of over pressure by as much as 20{\%} was observed. Time of arrival was roughly 20{\%} faster directly in front of the charge with a pressure amplification of 46{\%} relative to a spherical baseline charge of the same mass. This testing may reveal a more complete relationship between the pressure and angle from the explosive that could have applications for military and law enforcement with respect to best practices on blaster location for reduced over pressure exposure.},

A major feature of the present treatment is the use of the dimensionless Mach number in all shock equations; a further simplification is furnished by first developing mathematical equations for shock in steady flow, and then applying these equations to explosive shock by simple transformation of coordinates.},

abstract = {`Alex', an ultrafine aluminium powder, burns more rapidly than conventional aluminium powders in energetic materials. In TNT-based formulations, the increased rate of energy release leads to higher detonation pressures and velocities. In order to determine the rate of Alex combustion in solid explosives, and to further assess its effects on the detonation properties of TNT formulations, aquarium tests and detonation front curvature tests were performed on Tritonal variants. The aquarium tests definitively show that Alex combustion in detonating Tritonal is significantly faster than that of Cap45a, the conventional aluminium powder used for military explosives. Additional pressure and velocity measurements from the aquarium tests agree with previous experiments. The results of detonation front measurements were less conclusive, but show qualitive trends that support existing data.},

In this paper, the methods previously published are discussed and shown to introduce a significant overestimation due to the erroneous thermodynamic assumptions - ideal gas behaviour and isentropic vapour expansion - on which they are based (in fact, they give the maximum value of overpressure which can be caused by a BLEVE). A new approach is proposed, based on the - more realistic - assumption of an adiabatic and irreversible expansion process; the real properties of the substance involved in the explosion are used. The two methods are compared through the application to a given case. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {There is always an increasing demand for most modular, flexible, and integrated solutions. This in turn is causing designers to find ways of enhancing their product offerings in response to such demand. Designs are fast becoming more commonplace, in part because technology advances are making them easer and also because an integrated solution functions more effectively as a whole rather than the sum of the individual elements that comprise it. An electric drive is the electromechanical system that converts electrical energy to mechanical motion of the driven machine. As a rule, it has more capability than the separate motor, gear, or power converter in their composition. To meet the application requirements, every component must be evaluated according to its own capability before selecting it for use on a drive. This must be considered when selecting and tuning multiple motor-gear-converter combinations. This book is intended primarily for the university-level learners of an electromechanical profile, including the bachelor and master students majored in electrical engineering and mechatronics. It will help also technicians and engineers of respective specialities. Those who have completed the basics of electric drive are welcome to this advanced course. The},

@article{Oran2007,
abstract = {This paper summarizes a 10-year theoretical and numerical effort to understand the deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT). To simulate DDT from first principles, it is necessary to resolve the relevant scales ranging from the size of the system to the flame thickness, a range that can cover up to 12 orders of magnitude in real systems. This computational challenge resulted in the development of numerical algorithms for solving coupled partial and ordinary differential equations and a new method for adaptive mesh refinement to deal with multiscale phenomena. Insight into how, when, and where DDT occurs was obtained by analyzing a series of multidimensional numerical simulations of laboratory experiments designed to create a turbulent flame through a series of shock-flame interactions. The simulations showed that these interactions are important for creating the conditions in which DDT can occur. Flames enhance the strength of shocks passing through a turbulent flame brush and generate new shocks. In turn, shock interactions with flames create and drive the turbulence in flames. The turbulent flame itself does not undergo a transition, but it creates conditions in nearby unreacted material that lead to ignition centers, or "hot spots," which can then produce a detonation through the Zeldovich gradient mechanism involving gradients of reactivity. Obstacles and boundary layers, through their interactions with shocks and flames, help to create environments in which hot spots can develop. Other scenarios producing reactivity gradients that can lead to detonations include flame-flame interactions, turbulent mixing of hot products with reactant gases, and direct shock ignition. Major unresolved questions concern the properties of nonequilibrium, shock-driven turbulence, stochastic properties of ignition events, and the possibility of unconfined DDT.},

All tests were conducted in accordance with INTEREG, Transport of Dangerous Goods, 1981 Edition. A first series of type 6a, single package tests, were conducted on single drums of ammonium perchlorate, each confined in all direcions by 1 m (3.2 ft) In all tests the material thermally decomposed. There was no explosion, no overpressure detected, and no rupture, splitting, or fragmenting of the drum. In a second series of type 6a, single package tests on single drums of ammonium perchlorate confined in the same manner as in the first type 6a series, the initiation source was a number 8 blasting cap. In this series the ammonium perchlorate also thermally decomposed and there was no explosion, no overpresure detected, and no rupture, splitting, or fragmenting of the drums. For control and information purposes, a single drum of ammonium perchlorate was tested unconfined using an S94 squib and 56.7 g (2 oz) of FFF black powder as the ignition source. The ignition of the black powder caused the drum lid to pop off and ejected approximately one-third of the ammonium perchlorate from the drum. The ammonium perchlorate did not react or thermally decompose and there was no damage to the drum. The series of 6b stack tests was not conducted due to the lack of any explosive effect in either of the type 6a, single package test series. This is in accordance with paragraph 4.5.5 of the INTEREG standard. A type 6c bonfire test was conducted consisting of five drums of ammonium perchlorate steel-banded together and placed atop a steel crib approximately I m (3.28 ft) above the ground and surrounded by 500 mm of lumber drenched with approximately 53 liters (14 gallons) of diesel fuel and gasoline mixture (9:1 ratio). The entire mass was ignited by two sets of electric matches and 56.7 g (2 oz) of black powder set 180 degrees apart at the base of the stack. The ammonium perchlorate was consumed by the fire with no explosions, no overpresure detected, and no rupture, splitting, or fragmenting of the drums. Based upon interpretation of test results as outlined, ammonium perchlorate nominal 2 0 0 -micron particle size, in 113.4 kg (250 lb) quantities in steel shipping drums does not meet the requirements for a Class I material.},

LDA is a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model, in which each item of a collection is modeled as a finite mixture over an underlying set of topics. Each topic is, in turn, modeled as an infinite mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities. In the context of text modeling, the topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document. We present efficient approximate inference techniques based on variational methods and an EM algorithm for empirical Bayes parameter estimation. We report results in document modeling, text classification, and collaborative filtering, comparing to a mixture of unigrams model and the probabilistic LSI model.},

abstract = {Detonator accuracy is extremely important to produce better fragmentation and for controlling vibrations. To control such problems, tests were performed to check the accuracy of electric detonators manufactured by a leading manufacturing company in the United States. These tests were conducted at the University of Missouri–Rolla (UMR) as part of a Graduate research program. Testing was conducted simultaneously with the Velocity of Detonation and the two Airblast meters. There was a reasonably good consistency of results shown by the Velocity of Detonation and the two airblast meters. The testing confirmed the accuracy and reliability of a relatively simple and inexpensive procedure for testing the accuracy of detonators. INTRODUCTION During the period starting from early 1600 up to 1940 accurate means of blasthole timings were not in vogue, both cap and fuse, and later electric detonators, that had long period delays, were used in the initiation system. Delayed blastholes showed better fragmentation than simultaneously blasting.},

@article{Srihakulung2011,
abstract = {production, TNT (Trinitrotoluene) play a significant role since World War I and II. Various types of military weapon utilize TNT in casting process. However, the TNT casting process for warhead is difficult to control the cooling rate of the liquid TNT. This problem occurs because the casting process lacks the equipment to detect the temperature during the casting procedure This study presents the temperature detected by infrared camera to illustrate the cooling rate and cooling zone of curing, and demonstrates the optimization of TNT condition to reduce the risk of air gap occurred in the warhead which can result in the destruction afterward. Premature initiation of explosive-filled projectiles in response to set-back forces during gun-firing cause by casting defects. Finally the study can help improving the process of the TNT casting. The operators can control the curing of TNT inside the case by rising up the heating rod at the proper time. Consequently this can reduce tremendous time of rework if the air gaps occur and increase strength to lower elastic modulus. Therefore, it can be clearly concluded that the use of Infrared Cameras in this process is another method to improve the casting procedure.},

Therefore, "routine measurements" or "standard vibration consulting services" are being carried out by numerous firms with widely different qualifications. Without good practice, the danger of deterioration in the quality of the data has increased. Therefore standards of workmanship must be set. Since, when pre and post blast inspections are made, one can be ensured that the final inspection will never show a similar number of cracks. An investigation of damage to buildings as a function of the magnitude of the vibrations and the ageing of the building must be established. To assist the industry, guidelines are outlined for measurement techniques, based on the simple relationship: PPV {\~{}} (k) (SD) A (-S) Using an example based on an occurrance and standard proceedures which are normally followed and inhered to by the mining and quarrying industry a number of easy but misleading answers can be arrived at.

C{\&}E News (1995) 6]. While small-scale tests of these "deterred" AN formulations appeared promising, larger amounts (30 pounds under confinement) were found to be detonable, though with reduced performance [Institute of Makers of Explosives Report, 1995]. In this study thermal analysis was used to screen a large number of AN formulations in search of possible deterrents. The sodium, potassium, ammonium and calcium salts of sulfate, phosphate, or carbonate as well as certain high-nitrogen organics (urea, oxalate, formate, guanidinum salts) were chosen because they should enhance AN thermal stability and because they could be used with agricultural products. This study considers whether laboratory tests can be used as benchmarks in evaluating explosivity. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

One is that, as I said in the postscript to one of the earlier volumes, I am at a career stage where my time is possibly best spent setting out knowledge and ideas I have built up over the decades for the benefit of younger readers. BookBoon provides a splendid medium for this. That is why I very much hope that this fourth in the series will be by no means the last even though I can appreciate the advisability of letting at least a few months elapse before I start work on the fifth. Another reason for my having contributed to BookBoon's range of titles is that the idea of having quality texts financed by advertisements and accessible at no charge is a very good one deserving support. A former colleague in Australia to whom I sent a copy of one of the earlier ones made this very comment. Yet another reason has been anticipated in the previous sentence: I have been able to send the book to friends and colleagues and have been encouraged by the warmth of their responses. Finally, I have derived pleasure and satisfaction from the writing of these volumes.},

abstract = {The maximum rates of pressure rise during closed vessel explosions of propane-air mixtures are reported, for systems with various initial concentrations, pressures and temperatures ([C3H8]=2.50-6.20vol.{\%}, p0=0.3-1.3bar; T0=298-423K). Experiments were performed in a spherical vessel (??=10cm) with central ignition. The deflagration (severity) index KG, calculated from experimental values of maximum rates of pressure rise is examined against the adiabatic deflagration index, KG, ad, computed from normal burning velocities and peak explosion pressures. At constant temperature and fuel/oxygen ratio, both the maximum rates of pressure rise and the deflagration indices are linear functions of total initial pressure, as reported for other fuel-air mixtures. At constant initial pressure and composition, the maximum rates of pressure rise and deflagration indices are slightly influenced by the initial temperature; some influence of the initial temperature on maximum rates of pressure rise is observed only for propane-air mixtures far from stoichiometric composition. The differentiated temperature influence on the normal burning velocities and the peak explosion pressures might explain this behaviour. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Terrorist bombings remain a significant threat in the United States. However, minimal longitudinal data exists regarding the medical and public health impact because of bombings. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the number of incidents, injuries, and deaths because of explosive, incendiary, premature, and attempted bombings from January 1983 to December 2002. Morbidity and mortality by motives, target locations, and materials used were evaluated. RESULTS: In the United States, 36,110 bombing incidents, 5,931 injuries, and 699 deaths were reported. There were 21,237 (58.8{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}) explosive bombings, 6,185 (17.1{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}) incendiary bombings, 1,107 (3.1{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}) premature bombings, and 7,581 (21.0{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}) attempted bombings. For explosive bombings with known motives, 72.9{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}} of injuries and 73.8{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}} of deaths were because of homicide. For incendiary bombings with known motives, 68.2{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}} of injuries were because of extortion and revenge, and 53.5{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}} of deaths were due to homicide. Private residences accounted for 29.0{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}} of incidents, 31.5{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}} of injuries, and 55.5{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}} of deaths.

In bombings with known materials, nitrate-based fertilizers accounted for 36.2{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}} of injuries and 30.4{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}} of deaths, and smokeless powder and black powder accounted for 33.2{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}} of injuries and 27.1{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}} of deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Illegal bombings and related injuries commonly occur in the United States. Because of the easy availability of bombing materials, government agencies and healthcare providers should prepare for potential mass-casualty bombings.},

@article{Damodaran2008a,
abstract = {In business and investing, risk has traditionally been viewed negatively: investors and companies can lose money due to risk and therefore we typically penalize companies for taking risks. That's why most books on risk management focus strictly on hedging or mitigating risk. But the enterprise's relationship with risk should be far more nuanced. Great companies become great because they seek out and exploit intelligent risks, not because they avoid all risk. Strategic Risk Taking: A Framework for Risk Management is the first book to take this broader view, encompassing both risk hedging at one end of the spectrum and strategic risk taking on the other. World-renowned financial pioneer Aswath Damodaran–one of BusinessWeek's top 12 business school professors–is singularly well positioned to take this strategic view. Here, Damodaran helps you separate good risk (opportunities) from bad risk (threats), showing how to utilize the former while protecting yourself against the latter. He introduces powerful financial tools for evaluating risk, and demonstrates how to draw on other disciplines to make these tools even more effective. Simply put, Damodaran has written the first book that helps you use risk to increase firm value, drive higher growth and returns, and create real competitive advantage. • Risk: the history and the psychology The non-financial realities you must understand to successfully manage risk • Risk assessment: from the basics to the cutting edge Risk Adjusted Value, probabilistic approaches, Value at Risk, and more • Utilizing the power of real options Extending option pricing models to reflect the potential upside of risk exposure • Risk management: the big picture Integrating traditional finance with corporate strategy–and using risk strategically Back Flap About the Author Aswath Damodaran, Professor of Finance at NYU's Stern School of Business, has been profiled in BusinessWeek as one of the United States' top twelve business school professors. His researchinterests include valuation, portfolio management, and applied corporate finance. He is the author of Damodaran on Valuation; Investment Valuation; The Dark Side of Valuation; Corporate Finance: Theory and Practice; Applied Corporate Finance; and most recently, Investment Fables. Damodaran has published in The Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, The Journal of Finance, The Journal of Financial Economics, and The Review of Financial Studies. Back Cover Beyond Traditional Hedging: How to Use Risk Management Financial Techniques Strategically! •How to determine which risks to ignore, which to protect against, and which to actively exploit •By Aswath Damodaran, leading finance authority and one of BusinessWeek's top 12 business school professors •For every corporate finance executive, manager, analyst, consultant, researcher, and student In recent years, risk management has been defined as merely eliminating or reducing risk exposure. Companies are learning today that is far too narrow and constraining a definition. Risk, exploited judiciously, is absolutely central to business success. In Strategic Risk Taking: A Framework for Risk Management, Aswath Damodaran covers both sides of the risk equation, offering a complete framework for maximizing profit by limiting some risks and exploiting others. Damodaran presents a thorough and insightful review of the state-of-the-art in risk measurement, hedging, and mitigation. He covers a broad spectrum of risk assessment tools, including risk adjusted value, scenario analysis, decision trees, VAR, and real options. But Damodaran goes far beyond other treatments of the subject, helping you decide when to deliberately increase exposure to certain risks, and clearly assess the potential dangers and payoffs of doing so. http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/{\~{}}adamodar/},

abstract = {This report reviews nearly 50 chlorate manufacturers outside of China and the nearly 20 inside China (Appendix 1). In addition, Chinese companies whose role in chlorate distribution is particularly murky are discussed and listed (Appendix 2). Large-scale production of sodium chlorate is primarily in support of pulp and paper bleaching. Such facilities are often sited adjacent to their customers. It is rare that this material becomes available to the general public. However, there are other markets much more accessible to the general public such as herbicides (in some locations), fireworks, textile chemicals, and oxygen generation devices. Touched on, but not discussed at this time, are the importance of economic issues and the role of the distributor and the manufacturer of appropriate industrial equipment/facilities. In some markets hydrogen peroxide (HP) is a competitive alternative to chlorate; large manufacturers often produce both. Where this is the case, it is noted, although HP is intended to be the subject of a future report. Rationale},

@techreport{siskind1981,
abstract = {The Bureau of Mines studied blast-produced ground vibration from surface mining to assess its damage and annoyance potential, and to determine safe levels and appropriate measurement techniques. Direct measurements were made of ground-vibration-produced structure responses and {\textless}'amage in 76 homes for 219 production blasts. These results were combined with damage data from nine other blasting studies, including the three analyzed previously for Bureau of Mines Bulletin 656. Safe levels of ground vibration from blasting range from 0.5 to 2.0 in/sec peak p,article velocity for residential-type structures. The damage threshold values are functions of the frequencies of the vibration transmitted into the residences and the types of construction. Particularly serious are the low-frequency vibrations that exist in soft fo!Jndation materials and/or result from long blast-to-residence distances. These vibrations produce not only structure resO-nances (4 to 12 Hz for whole structures and 10 to 25Hz for midwalls) but also excessive levels of displacement and strain. Threshold damage was defined as the occurrence of cosmetic damage; that is, the most superficial interior cracking of the type that develops in all homes independent of blasting. Homes with plastered interior walls are more suscep-tible to blast-produced cracking then modern gypsum wallboard; the latter are adequately protected by a minimum particle velocity of approximately 0. 75 in/ sec for frequencies below 40 Hz. Structure response amplification factors were measured; typical values were 1.5 for structures as a whole (racking) and 4 for midwalls, at their respective resonance frequencies. For blast vibrations above 40 Hz, all amplification factors for frame residential structures were less than unity. The human response and annoyance problem from ground vibration is ag-gravated by wall rattling, secondary noises, and the presence of airblast. Ap-proximately 5 to 10 pet of the neighbors will judge peak particle velocity levels of0.5 to 0.75 in/sec as "less than acceptable" (i.e., unacceptable) based{\textperiodcentered}on direct reactions to the vibration. Even lower levels cause psychological response prob-lems, and thus social, economic, and public relations factors beCome critical for continued blasting.},

Several attempts at an early-theory quickly collapsed for lack of foundations in mathematics and thermodynamics. It is not until the works of Rankine and later Hugoniot that a full theory is established. Rankine is the first to show that within the shock a non-adiabatic process must occur. Hugoniot showed that in the absence of viscosity and heat conduction conservation of energy implies conservation of entropy in smooth regions and a jump in entropy across a shock. Even after the theory is fully developed, old notions continue to pervade the literature well into the early part of the 20th Century.},

abstract = {Mathematical Modeling 3e is a general introduction to an increasingly crucial topic for today's mathematicians. Unlike textbooks focused on one kind of mathematical model, this book covers the broad spectrum of modeling problems, from optimization to dynamical systems to stochastic processes. Mathematical modeling is the link between mathematics and the rest of the world. Meerschaert shows how to refine a question, phrasing it in precise mathematical terms. Then he encourages students to reverse the process, translating the mathematical solution back into a comprehensible, useful answer to the original question. This textbook mirrors the process professionals must follow in solving complex problems.Each chapter in this book is followed by a set of challenging exercises. These exercises require significant effort on the part of the student, as well as a certain amount of creativity. Meerschaert did not invent the problems in this book--they are real problems, not designed to illustrate the use of any particular mathematical technique. Meerschaert's emphasis on principles and general techniques offers students the mathematical background they need to model problems in a wide range of disciplines.This new edition will be accompanied by expanded and enhanced on-line support for instructors.

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. [Plates 8 and 9] An experimental study is made of the initiation and growth of explosion in a series of azides and fulminates. Some organic and inorganic azides which can be melted have been prepared. In the solid state the impact sensitivity of these azides is increased by the presence of a grit particle, provided its melting-point exceeds 5000 C. In the liquid state cyanuric triazide can be initiated by the adiabatic compression of a gas bubble, but even in the apparent absence of gas bubbles the molten explosive is very sensitive to impact. An investigation of the growth of the explosion from the point of initiation shows that with the organic azides the reaction can begin as a comparatively gentle burning which accelerates rapidly to detonation. There is evidence that the chemical reaction occurring in the slow stage is different from, and is less complete than, the reaction in the detonation stage. The comparison of a range of azides and of fulminates indicates that the ready pro-pagation of the explosion is associated with the covalent character of the molecule. Increasing the pressure of an inert gas, such as nitrogen, above the explosive has a marked effect in increasing the propagation of the explosion. Confinement has a similar effect, and the results are in agreement with Yoffe's conclusions from the thermal decom-position of the azides. They suggest that the rapid propagation of the explosion is due to the recombination of excited or atomic nitrogen at or near the surface of the explosive.},

abstract = {An investigation was made of the distances over which sympathetic detona- tion of ammonium nitrate (AN) and ammonium nitrate-fuel oil (AN-FO) might be expected. Large-scale gap tests used two types of AN-FO donor charges in three sizes with AN, both at ambient and elevated temperatures, and AN-FO acceptor charges. Donor sizes were varied to test the validity of a scaling law commonly used in quantity distance tables. The up-and-down experimental design was chosen to determine the 50-percent initiation point efficiently. The acceptor charges were instrumented to indicate initiation and to determine detonation velocity. Other electronic techniques for measuring the rate of growth, stability of detonation, and detonation pressures were employed. Air shock and fragment velocities between charges were measured by electronic and photographic methods, and determination of side-on air-blast pressures and impulse duration were made for about half the shots. Separation distances between donor and acceptor were found to be larger than anticipated both for the AN and the AN-FO. With AN-FO acceptors and a 16-gage steel faced donor, one initiation occurred at a separation of 53 feet or nearly 16-charge diameters; with AN, initiation occurred at 4 to 5-1/2- charge diameters.},

@techreport{Davies2003,
abstract = {1.1 Identity, physical and chemical properties, and analytical methods Nitrobenzene is a colourless to pale yellow oily liquid with an odour resembling that of bitter almonds or "shoe polish." It has a melting point of 5.7 (degrees)C and a boiling point of 211 (degrees)C. Its vapour pressure is 20 Pa at 20 (degrees)C, and its solubility in water is 1900 mg/litre at 20 (degrees)C. It represents a fire hazard, with a flash point (closed cup method) of 88 (degrees)C and an explosive limit (lower) of 1.8{\%} by volume in air. Its log octanol/water partition coefficient is 1.85. A range of analytical methods is available for the quantification of nitrobenzene in air, water and soil samples. Methods for the monitoring of workers systemically exposed to nitrobenzene are also available. A reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic method for the determination of urinary metabolites, including p-nitrophenol (also a urinary metabolite of the organophosphorus insecticides parathion and parathion-methyl), appears suitable. Methods are also available for the determination of aniline released from haemoglobin adducts and for the determination of methaemoglobin, which is produced by nitrobenzene metabolites. 1.2 Sources of human and environmental exposure Nitrobenzene does not occur naturally. It is a synthetic compound, more than 95{\%} of which is used in the production of aniline, a major chemical intermediate that is used in the manufacture of polyurethanes; nitrobenzene is also used as a solvent in petroleum refining, as a solvent in the manufacture of cellulose ethers and acetates, in the manufacture of dinitrobenzenes and dichloroanilines, and in the synthesis of other organic compounds, including acetaminophen. Early in the 20th century, nitrobenzene had some use as a food additive (substitute for almond essence) as well as extensive use as a solvent in various proprietary products, including boot polish, inks (including inks used for stamping freshly laundered hospital baby diapers) and several disinfectants, so there was a significant potential for public exposure at that time. From available records, it is apparent that there has been a significant increase in annual production of nitrobenzene over the past 30-40 years. Most is retained in closed systems for use in further synthesis, particularly of aniline, but also of substituted nitrobenzenes and anilines. Losses during production of nitrobenzene are likely to be low; when nitrobenzene is used as a solvent, however, emissions may be higher. Nitrobenzene has been shown to be emitted from sewage sludge incineration units and has been measured in air at hazardous waste landfills. Nitrobenzene can be formed from the atmospheric reaction of benzene in the presence of nitrogen oxides, although this source has not been quantified. Aniline has been reported to be slowly oxidized by ozone to nitrobenzene. 1.3 Environmental transport, distribution and transformation Nitrobenzene can undergo degradation by both photolysis and microbial biodegradation. The physical properties of nitrobenzene suggest that transfer from water to air will be significant, although not rapid. Photodegradation of nitrobenzene in air and water is slow. From direct photolysis experiments in air, lifetimes of {\textless}1 day were determined, whereas the calculated half-lives for the reaction with hydroxyl radicals were in the range between 19 and 223 days. With ozone, the reaction proceeds even more slowly. Experiments in a smog chamber with a propylene/butane/nitrogen dioxide mixture gave an estimated lifetime for nitrobenzene between 4 and 5 days. In water bodies, direct photolysis appears to be the degradation pathway that proceeds most rapidly (half-lives between 2.5 and 6 days), whereas indirect photolysis (photo-oxidation with hydroxyl radicals, hydrogen atoms or hydrated electrons, sensitization with humic acids) plays a minor role (calculated half-lives between 125 days and 13 years for the reaction with hydroxyl radicals, depending on sensitizer concentration). Due to its moderate water solubility and relatively low vapour pressure, it might be expected that nitrobenzene would be washed out of the atmosphere by rain to some extent; however, in field experiments, it appeared that washout by rainfall (either through solution in raindrops or by removal of nitrobenzene sorbed onto particulates) and dryfall of particulates was negligible. Because of its vapour density (4.1-4.25 times that of air), removal processes from the atmosphere may include settling of vapours. Actual data on evaporation of nitrobenzene from water bodies appear to be somewhat conflicting, with a computer model predicting volatilization half-lives of 12 days (river) to 68 days (eutrophic lake). The shortest estimate cited in the literature was 1 day (from river water); in another study of experimental microcosms, simulating land application of wastewater, nitrobenzene was reported not to volatilize but to be totally degraded. Degradation studies suggest that nitrobenzene is degraded in sewage treatment plants by aerobic processes, with slower degradation under anaerobic conditions. Nitrobenzene may not necessarily be completely degraded if it is present at high concentrations in wastewater. High concentrations may also inhibit the biodegradation of other wastes. Biodegradation of nitrobenzene depends mainly on the acclimation of the microbial population. Degradation by non-acclimated inocula is generally very slow to negligible and proceeds only after extended acclimation periods. Acclimated microorganisms, particularly from industrial wastewater treatment plants, however, showed complete elimination of nitrobenzene within a few days. Degradation was generally found to be increased in the presence of other easily degradable substrates. Adaptation of the microflora and additional substrates also seem to be the limiting factors for the decomposition of nitrobenzene in soil. Degradation of nitrobenzene under anaerobic conditions has been shown to be very slow, even after extended acclimation periods. The measured bioconcentration factors for nitrobenzene in a number of organisms indicate minimal potential for bioaccumulation, and nitrobenzene is not biomagnified through the food-chain. Nitrobenzene may be taken up by plants; in available studies, however, it appeared to be associated with roots, and very little was associated with other parts of the plant. In a simulated "farm pond" aquatic ecosystem, nitrobenzene remained mainly in the water and was neither stored nor ecologically magnified in water fleas, mosquito larvae, snails, algae, miscellaneous plankton or fish. 1.4 Environmental levels and human exposure Concentrations of nitrobenzene in environmental samples such as surface water, groundwater and air are generally low. Some measured levels in air in US cities in the early 1980s ranged between {\textless}0.05 and 2.1 (mu)g/m3 ({\textless}0.01 and 0.41 ppb) (arithmetic means). Data reported by the US Environmental Protection Agency in 1985 indicated that less than 25{\%} of air samples in the USA were positive, with a median concentration of about 0.05 (mu)g/m3 (0.01 ppb); in urban areas, mean levels were generally less than 1 (mu)g/m3 (0.2 ppb), with slightly higher levels in industrial areas (mean 2.0 (mu)g/m3 [0.40 ppb]). Of 49 air samples measured in Japan in 1991, 42 had a detectable level, measured as 0.0022-0.16 (mu)g/m3. Levels over urban areas and waste disposal sites were significantly lower (or undetectable) in winter than in summer. Data on nitrobenzene levels in surface water appear to be more extensive than data on levels in air. While levels are variable depending on location and season, generally low levels (around 0.1-1 (mu)g/litre) have been measured. One of the highest levels reported was 67 (mu)g/litre, in the river Danube, Yugoslavia, in 1990. However, nitrobenzene was not detected in any surface water samples collected near a large number of hazardous waste sites in the USA (reported in 1988). Based on limited data, it appears that there may be greater potential for contamination of groundwater than of surface water; several sites measured in the USA in the late 1980s had levels of 210-250 and 1400 (mu)g/litre (with much higher levels at a coal gasification site). Nitrobenzene has been reported in studies conducted in the 1970s and 1980s on drinking-water in the USA and the United Kingdom, albeit in only a small proportion of samples, but was not detected in 30 Canadian samples (1982 report). No data on nitrobenzene occurrence in food were located, although Japanese studies conducted in 1991 detected it in a small proportion (4 of 147) of fish samples. It was not detected in a large range of sampled biota in a 1985 US study. The general population can be exposed to variable concentrations of nitrobenzene in air and possibly drinking-water. There is also potential exposure from consumer products, but accurate information is lacking. In studies conducted in the state of New Jersey on the eastern coast of the USA (warm to hot summers and cold to very cold winters), urban areas had higher levels in summer than in winter due to both the formation of nitrobenzene by nitration of benzene (from petrol) and the higher volatility of nitrobenzene during the warmer months; ambient air exposure in the winter may be negligible. Based on air studies and on estimates of releases during manufacture, only populations in the vicinity of manufacturing activities (i.e., producers and industrial consumers of nitrobenzene for subsequent synthesis) and petroleum refining plants are likely to have any significant exposure to nitrobenzene. However, people living in and around abandoned hazardous waste sites may also have the potential for higher exposure, due to possible groundwater and soil contamination and uptake of nitrobenzene by plants.},

The shock wave is generated by the detonation of a hemispherical gaseous charge in one of the rooms. Several small-scale experiments have been carried out using an adjustable model representative of a pyrotechnic workshop. Using the same approach as for a previous article dealing with the impact of the volume of the rooms, we were able to link the evolution of the arrival time of the shock wave within the building with the reference obtained in the free field. Moreover, using a new parameter taking into account the opening ratios of the rooms and side walls, a predictive law was developed to model the maximal overpressure in the rooms.},

abstract = {In the past decade, there has been an increasing demand from governments for high level protections for military vehicles against explosives. However, the design and validation of protection is a time consuming and expensive process, where previous experience plays an important role. Development time and weight are the driving factors, where the weight influences vehicle performance. Numerical simulations are used as a tool in the design process, in order to reduce development time and successively improve the protection. The explosive load acting on a structure is sometimes described with analytical functions, with limitations to shape and type of the explosive, confinement conditions etc. An alternative way to describe the blast load is to use numerical simulations based on continuum mechanics. The blast load is determined by modelling the actual type and shape of the explosive in air or soil, where the explosive force transfers to the structure of interest. However, accuracy of the solution must be considered, where methods and models should be validated against experimental data. Within this work, tests with explosive placed in air, soil or a steel pot have been performed, where the blast load acts on steel target plates resulting in large deformations up to fracture. For the non-fractured target plates, the maximum dynamic and residual deformations of steel plates were measured, while the impulse transfer was measured in some tests. This},

@article{Wachtell1963,
abstract = {Experimental demonstrated that when a large mass of an explosive or propellant is burned in a closed system, a sharp change in slope of the burning rate/pressure curve occurs at a pressure which is specific for that material. From the transition pressure and the slope of the transition curve and from the physical configuration of a missile motor, the hazard of detonation may be determined. To extend the range of measurements possible, a pressure vessel has been developed in which measurements of propellant burning rate at pressures as high as 250,000 psi can be made. This vessel has a unique design consisting of two concentric cylinders. Radial stresses are taken by the inner cylinder, which is replaceable if fracture should occur. Recording of pressure information precedes fracture of the inner vessel. The outer cylinder carriers only axial stresses and is of sufficient strength to prevent fracture and retain fragments. The development of this vessel also made possible the examination of burning characteristics of cannon propellants for very high pressure applications. Results show that some standard cannon propellants have transition characteristics similar to those described for explosives and rocket propellants. This phenomenon explains some disastrous incidents resulting from very high pressure gun firings.},

abstract = {Obtaining reliable side-on pressure values from shock waves in air requires copious amounts of preparation, particularly for mounting and aligning the sensors. However, scrupulous attention to detail will be to no avail if the sensors used are not properly calibrated or suffer from an inherent error. Until recently most laboratories had to rely on a single manufacturer of blast pencil probes either as sole supplier or as provider of reference sensors. Towards the end of 2015, a competitor launched its own pencil probes, offering an alternative. Laboratories are now facing the question, whether the two products deliver comparable results. Considering the fact that the two manufacturers apply inherently different methods to calibrate their sensors, this issue gets even more pressing. To resolve this problem, five pencil probes of each manufacturer were tested in a shock tube at different peak pressure levels. For each shot sensors of both manufacturers were mirror-symmetrically placed inside the shock tube and two pressure gauges for interior ballistics (placed in the mirror plane) were used as reference. The signals obtained from the sensors were then used to determine the consistency of each product and the deviation of the individual signals from the reference.},

Nothing appeared to be further from his intention. He lounged up and down the pavement and gazed vacantly at the ground, the sky, the opposite houses. Having finished his scrutiny, he proceeded slowly down the path, keeping his eyes riveted on the ground. " Dr. Watson A Study in Scarlet Sir Arthur Conan Doyle Sherlock Holmes, the master of detectives, considered it essential to be excruciatingly disciplined in his approach to looking for evidence at a crime scene. While it is imperative that all investigators apply discipline in their search for evidence, it is apparent that few do so in the same way. Currently, there are no nationally accepted guidelines or standard practices for conducting explosion or bombing scene investigations. Professional training exists through Federal, State, and local agencies responsible for these investigations, as well as through some organizations and academic institutions. The authors of this Guide strongly encourage additional training for public safety personnel. Purpose and Scope The principal purpose of this Guide is to provide an investigative outline of the tasks that should be considered at every explosion scene. They will ensure that proper procedures are used to locate, identify, collect, and preserve valuable evidence so that it can be examined to produce the most useful and effective information - best practices.

Reactions in initiating shocks were studied by measuring pressure and specific volume in the shocked state (2 to 100 kbar) for the physically similar granular reactive and nonreactive aggregates ammonium perchlorate (a low-power, insensitive explosive) and potassium chloride (an inert comparison material). Longitudinal sound velocities iu compacts of the same material, over a range of bulk densities and grain sizes, were also measured. Loci of shocked states for NH4 CIO4 and KC1 aggregates show a dramatic qualitative difference, leading us to the conclusion that reaction occurs at the shock front. This conclusion opens the possibilities that nonreac- tive shocks in granular explosives and propellants do not exist, that the amount of initial reaction is related to the shock pressure, and that mechanisms of buildup to steady detonaticn must take into account reaction from time of shock entry. Finally, a dependence of transition behavior on grain size was demonstrated; the faster transition from shock to detonation occurs for smaller grain size, i.e., larger grain surface per unit volume.},

Black powder derived from oak and maple charcoals was compared, and the effects of processing the material by a jet mill or ball mill were contrasted. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that applied pressure, a manufacturing step used in making black powder, induced considerable plastic flow that resulted in a fused conglomerate, cohesive mass containing interconnecting passageways of about 0.1 micron diameter. Density, free volume, and surface area were found to be functions of burning rate. Based on these relationships, the conclusion was offered that the degree of openness of a grain of black powder is a significant factor affecting its burning rate.},

@article{Langlie1965,
abstract = {1. INTRODUCTION. As a result of many reliability problems which have plagued procuring agencies in the missile and space programs, increased emphasis has been placed on the development of improved reliability demon-stration test methods. In this connection, the Army has advocated increased use of the "test-to-failure" concept to establish the existence of satisfactory margins of reliability with respect to critical factors. This philosophy has the advantage in that statistical statements can be made regarding reliability on the basis of relatively small samples. This paper will discuss the appli-cation of this general concept to a particular class of hardware. In essence, the "test-to-failure" concept involves submitting a test specimen to an increasing environment or load stress until failure is detected. By observing the statistical behavior of the stresses at which failure occurs, the lower limit of stress below which the probability of failure is very small can be selected by using the mean and standard deviation of these data. Robert Lusser (reference 1) advocated the safety margin concept in inter-preting these data. As is shown in Figure 1, the larger the value of k * (which is the distance from the mean strength to the upper limit of the oper-ating applied stress divided by the standard deviation of the data), the greater the reliability of the specimen with respect to the stress involved. In establishing the reliability objectives for the Shillelagh Program, the Army Missile Command required that safety margins be demonstrated in the test laboratory for Shillelagh components with respect to critical environ-mental stress factors. Many of these components are of a "go-no-gon type such as thermal batteries, electrical relays, and other short-lived equip-ment items. In most cases, little information was available prior to test regarding the nature of the standard deviation of the distribution of strenghts for these parts. Furthermore, it was desired to perform a laboratory test involving a minimum number of samples. A review of attribute sensitivity testing techniques such as the Up and Down method (reference 2) and the Probit method (reference 3) indicated that these methods cannot be applied satisfactorily under the sample size and technical limitations imposed. As a result, a study was made to develop a method for selecting stress levels for testing which required no a'priori assumption regarding the standard deviation of the unknown strength distribution and could be performed satis-factorily with sample sizes of the order of fifteen or twenty.},

abstract = {The objective is to compare the ignition and detonation properties of various liquid high explosives having negative up to positive oxygen balance (OB): nitromethane (OB {\textless} 0), saccharose and hydrogen peroxide based mixture (quasi nil OB), hydrogen peroxide with more than 90{\%} purity (OB {\textgreater} 0). The decomposition kinetic rates and the equations of state (EOS) for the liquid mixtures and detonation products (DP) are the input data for a detonation model. EOS are theoretically determined using the Woolfolk et al. universal liquid polar shock law and thermochemical computations for DP. The decomposition kinetic rate laws are determined to reproduce the shock to detonation transition for the mixtures submitted to planar plate impacts. Such a model is not sufficient to compute open field explosions. The aerial overpressure is well reproduced in the first few microseconds, however, after it becomes worse at large expansion of the fireball and the impulse is underestimated. The problem of the DP EOS alone is that it takes only the detonation into account, the secondary combustion DP-air is not considered. To solve this problem a secondary combustion model has been developed to take the OB effect into account. The detonation model has been validated on planar plate impact experiments. The secondary combustion parameters were deduced from thermochemical computations. The whole model has been used to predict the effects of the oxygen balance on open air blast effects of spherical charges. {\textcopyright} Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Although their ideas and results remain of current interest, many of these papers have been hard to find, since the journals in which they were published are not available in many libraries. The editors have also translated papers written in French to make them accessible to a wider audience.

One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

abstract = {The NASA Lewis Research Center's Principal Investigator Microgravity Services project analyzes Orbital Acceleration Research Experiment and Space Acceleration Measurement System data for principal investigators of microgravity experiments. Principal investigators need a thorough understanding of data analysis techniques so that they can request appropriate analyses to best interpret accelerometer data. Accelerometer data sampling and filtering is introduced along with the related topics of resolution and aliasing. Specific information about the Orbital Acceleration Research Experiment and Space Acceleration Measurement System data sampling and filtering is given. Time domain data analysis techniques are discussed and example environment interpretations are made using plots of acceleration versus time, interval average acceleration versus time, interval root-mean-square acceleration versus time, trimmean acceleration versus time, quasi-steady three dimensional histograms, and prediction of quasi-steady levels at different locations. An introduction to Fourier transform theory and windowing is provided along with specific analysis techniques and data interpretations. The frequency domain analyses discussed are power spectral density versus frequency, cumulative root mean-square acceleration versus frequency, root-mean-square acceleration versus frequency, one-third octave band root-mean-square acceleration versus frequency, and power spectral density versus frequency versus time (spectrogram). Instructions for accessing NASA Lewis Research Center accelerometer data and related information using the internet are provided.},

In the Dremel rotary tool test, the lock shackles were exposed to a Dremel abrasive cut¬ting wheel for a fixed time and the depth of penetration was measured. In the oxyacetylene test, the lock shackle was moved under an oxyacetylene flame at a constant velocity and the depth of cut was measured. In the drill press test, the lock was confined in a vice and two drill attempts were made using two different diameter drill bits and the percent of lock failures was recorded. In the low temperature impact test, a pendulum was dropped while the lock temperature was lowered using difluoroethane (canned air) and the percent of lock failures was recorded. Finally, in the compressive cutting test, the lock shackle was pressed by carbide tipped cutting jaws and the maximum force at failure was measured. Results were compared to a previous study and were in general agreement, except the low temperature impact test.},

abstract = {The velocimetry technique POV is easier to field than its predecessors VISAR and Fabry-Perot, works on a broader variety of experiments, and is more accurate and simple to analyze. Experiments and analysis have now demonstrated the accuracy, precision and interpretation of what POV does and does not measure, and the successful application of POV to basic and applied detonation problems. We present a selection of results intended to help workers assess the capabilities of POV. First we present general considerations about the tectmique: various POV configurations, single-signal, multi- signal (e.g., triature) and frequency-shifted PDV; what types of motion are sensed and missed by POV; analysis schemes for velocity and position extraction; accuracy and precision of the results; and, experimental consideratio{\~{}}s for probe selection and positioning. We then present the status of various applications: detonation speeds and wall motion in cylinder tests, breakout velocity distributions from bare HE, ejecta, measurements from fibers embedded in HE, projectile velocity, resolving 2 and 3-D velocity vectors. This paper is an overview of work done by many groups around the world.},

From Duplicate 2 (Development of Ultra-Fine Ammonium Perchlorate Technology - Flanigan, D. A.; Stephens, W. D.; Vance, S. L.)

A series of tests1 was run in which varying quantities of Sorbeads, spherical shaped prills of fused silica gel, were blended with the UFAP products to effect a desensitization. These tests, tabulated in Appendices D {\&} E, indicated that the addition of as little'as l0{\%} by weight of Sorbeads to the, UFAP products would prevent detonation at zero cards in the card gap test. In the lead column test, the percenitage of Sorbeads required to produce negative results varied with the' percent of theoretical material density ({\%} TMD), with between 25 and 35{\%} required for hand-packed samples, and between 10 and 25{\%}, for loosely-filled samples. Although anomnalous results were encountered since a calibration card gap test shot without any Sorbeads did not result in a positive test, a level of 30{\%} sorbeads was'selected to give a margin of safety. These desensitization tests were run usiing the UFAP compositions showning the greatest sensitivity iin Task IV work. Subsequent tests, discussed later in this page, indicated the Sorbead addition did not desensitize all types of UFAP materials.

The use of Sorebeads as a desensitizing diluent for UFAP provided an additional, very important benefit: the Sorebeads maintaned a very low relative humidity, less than 5{\%} inside the sealed stoarge containers, thereby minimizing the tendency for the particale size to grow due ot the equilibrim stability effects. Although other desicant forms might provide such protection, such as the bagged charges of desicant normally placed in the AP drums by the material manufacturer, only the distribution or dispersement of the Sorbead type material throughout the UFAP mass would effect desensitization of the explosive characeristics. Although unfused desicants could be blended in with UFAP, such material wold be subject to particle breakage and dusting resulting in contamination. The Sorbeads are also screened when received to remove any that will pass thorugh a nominal 6 mesh screen sieve. They can then be readily removed from the UFAP with a 10 mesh screen (or smaller opening), which is normally used to screen all AP materials prior to incorporation into large mixer propellant batches.},

The method is extended for use with casings made of pre-formed fragments. Finally, four conceptual preliminary designs, based on information acquired in the project, are investigated. The modifications made to the equations provide improved results and the examples confirm that the modified Gurney method is a quick, inexpensive tool for use in preliminary warhead design.},

abstract = {s this subject is being dealt with for the first time in these Reports, it seems desirable to touch briefly on the historical side and to cover the ground-A work fairly thoroughly, indicating the present trend of progress and lines of future development of the applications of spectroscopy to combustion without dealing in detail with all the latest original papers. It is convenient to divide the subject into four main sections.. The first deals with the more obvious approach to the subject, the visible and ultra-violet emission spectra of flames, explosions, cold flames, etc. The second section is devoted to absorption spectra, and the third section to the infra-red region. The last section, on the subject of energy considerations, is concerned with the large number of indirect but extremely fruitful applications of spectroscopy to com-bustion problems, such as the calculation of dissociation energies, specific heats, quantitative considerations of the lifetimes of activated molecules, and tem-perature measurement. 8 2. E M I S S I O N SPECTRA One of the first spectra studied was that of the candle flame, and as long ago as 1802 Wollaston described the banded spectrum which was later, in 1857, mapped by Swan, by whose name it is now usuauy known. Burch (1886), Smithells (1901) and many others observed the spectra emitted by various flames. Such observations were, however, of little help to the theory of com-bustion until theoretical developments in the interpretation of the rotational structure of diatomic band spectra and the systematization of such spectra by Hund (1926), Mulliken (1930-32) and others enabled the emitting molecules to be identified with some certainty. Such developments and systematization have been described by Jevons (1932).},

abstract = {The current CCPS/TNO's BLEVE (Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapor Explosion) overpressure methodology is largely derived from that published by Baker in 1975{\textless}sup{\textgreater}[1]{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}. This methodology calculates the explosion energy using an isentropic expansion assumption and Baker's graphical method. The overpressure is determined graphically assuming similarity between BLEVEs and high-explosives. Baker's work was based on limited data on vapor-filled vessels and the accuracy of his method for BLEVE overpressure calculations was not tested against experimental data due to the lack of data available. Many experimental studies on BLEVE overpressure (Giesbrecht{\textless}sup{\textgreater}[2]{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, Birk {\textless}sup{\textgreater}[3-5]{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, Bulke{\textless}sup{\textgreater}[6]{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, etc.) have been published since the early 80's. We have carried out a comprehensive review and found over 100 experimental data points from the existing literature. Based on a comparison of overpressure calculations to the literature data, we found that the CCPS/TNO's method over-predicts BLEVE side-on overpressures in the range of typical industrial application (1{\textless}R{\textless}10, and 1{\textless}P{\textless}inf{\textgreater}so{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}{\textless}100kpa), especially in the near field (R{\textless}4). We also found that for liquid-full vessels, the current method underestimates the overpressure in certain regions. Starting with Baker's algorithm, a new, more accurate methodology for BLEVE over-pressure prediction was developed. Based on recent developments in the literature, adiabatic irreversible expansion was assumed in calculating explosion energies. Baker's correlation was adjusted with new multipliers derived to ensure that no experimental overpressures are under-predicted. Different sets of multipliers were determined for both BLEVE and liquid-full cases. Overall, the new method is 10-50{\%} less conservative than the CCPS/TNO's method.},

It bridges the gap between theory and practice by including a combination of pertinent discussion and proven practical methods. For any given configuration and flight condition, and complete set of stability and control derivatives can be determined without resort to outside information. A spectrum of methods is presented, ranging from very simple and easily applied techniques to quite accurate and thorough procedures. Comparatively simple methods are presented in complete form, while the more complex methods are often handled by reference to separate treatments. Tables which compare calculated results with test data provide indications of method accuracy. Extensive references to related material are also included.},

abstract = {Since there is an increasing interest in avoiding human body injury in diverse situations like crowd control or peacekeeping missions, less lethal ammunition are more and more used. In this study we focus only on kinetic energy non-lethal (KENLW) projectiles. Their desired effects on human body are the temporary incapacitation through blunt trauma. There are different types of KENLW projectiles ranging from rigid to deformable projectiles. Unfortunately, the effects of such projectiles are not really well known as it is difficult to measure the force transmitted to the human body or the related deformation. Because the potential of injury excludes human living tests, tests are performed on cadavers, animals or human tissue surrogates. Besides these tests, numerical simulations are more and more used to gain more understanding, to assess or to predict the effects of this kind of projectile on human body. In this paper a comparison based on the viscous criterion between the 37 mm rigid projectile and the 40 mm sponge projectile was made.},

They permit replication, energy transformation, and transmission of foods within plants, animals, and act as essential natural building materials. Polymers have served as the very building blocks of society—clays for jars, wood for fuel, hides for clothing, vegetation for food, and wood and concrete for shelter. They are present in a variety of forms, such as fibers and cloths, lumber, elastomers, plastics, coatings, adhesives, ceramics, enzymes, DNA, concretes, and are major ingredients in soils and plant life. The basic concepts of polymer science apply equally to natural and synthetic polymers and to inorganic and organic polymers, and are important in medicine, nutrition, engineering, biology, physics, mathematics, computers, environment, space, ecology, health, etc. Polymer science waited until an understanding of basic scientific principles and concepts such as atoms, electrons, periodic table, balanced equations, and chemical structures were in place. The importance of polymeric materials is today accepted as basic chemistry within the chemistry curriculum of most chemistry courses. This chapter highlights some important scientific concepts of polymer science.},

@inproceedings{Tatom2018,
abstract = {In the U.S., the storage of commercial explosives is regulated by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (BATFE, more commonly known as ATF). For such storage, ATF uses the American Table of Distances (ATD, or TOD) for their Quantity-Distance (QD) rules. These QD rules refer to “High Explosives” and “Low Explosives” rather than the United Nations (UN) hazard division/classification system. In recent years, ATF has been considering harmonizing their standards to more closely match what the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) does for QD rules, at least in the high/low designation. Such harmonization is generally a positive development. However, a familiarity with both QD and hazard classification suggests that the rules and assumptions of one discipline might not translate directly to another. For example, hazard classification designations intended for transportation situations may seem misleading if applied to storage situations, with completely different details, such as quantity, confinement, initiation mechanisms, etc. Therefore, it is important to discuss what one community (storage) does with the same explosives that another community (transportation) has “classified” for a different purpose. In such a discussion, considerations can be made such that a harmonization effort does not unintentionally lose some good aspect of the old high/low designation system while transitioning to a new system. The end goal would be a more standardized system, but also one that is appropriately designed for the intended application.},

An optical technique which permits recording the position of a very small region of a surface as a function of time is described. The surface must reflect light specularly, the arrangement must allow some space in front of the surface, and the radius of curvature of the surface must be large compared with the distance over which the position is of interest. There are no other restrictions on the surfaces to which the technique may be applied. The apparent position of the image of an object reflected in the free surface to be studied is recorded with a moving-image smear camera, and velocity is obtained from the record of position as a function of time. This technique has been used to measure velocities between 5X103 and 5X105 cm/sec in times as short as 3XlO-8 sec for research with high explosives.},

They employed spherical TNT charges which were detonated at selected heights above the ground. The charges were cast in one piece by the DRES explosive cast- ing facility, and weighed approximately 1000 pounds (454 kilograms) each. After detonation of each of the shots, repairs were made to the ground zero area so that the same site could be used throughout the Series.},

abstract = {The explosive and deflagration properties of black powder differ significantly from those of modern propellants and compositions based on ammonium nitrate or ammonium perchlorate. Possessing a high combustibility, black powder is capable of maintaining stable combustion at high velocities in various shells, be it steel shells or thin-walled plastic tubes, without experiencing deflagration-to-detonation transition. It is extremely difficult to detonate black powder, even using a powerful booster detonator. The results of numerical simulations of a number of key experiments on the convective combustion and shock initiation of black powder described in the literature are presented. The calculations were performed within the framework of a model developed previously for describing the convective combustion of granulated pyroxylin powders, with small modifications being introduced to allow for the specific properties of black powder. The thermophysical properties of the products of combustion and detonation and the parameters of the equation of state of black powder were determined from thermodynamic calculations. The calculation results were found to be in close agreement with the experimental data. The simulation results were used to analyze the regularities of the wave processes in the system and their relation to the properties of black powder and the experimental conditions. It was demonstrated that the effects observed could be explained by a weak dependence of the burning rate of black powder on the pressure.},

@article{Cooper2008,
abstract = {The term ''TNT Equivalence'' is used throughout the explosives and$\backslash$nrelated industries to compare the effects of the output of a given$\backslash$nexplosive to that of TNT. This is done for technical design reasons$\backslash$nin scaling calculation such as for the prediction of blast waves,$\backslash$ncraters, and structural response, and is also used as a basis for$\backslash$ngovernment regulations controlling the shipping, handling and storage$\backslash$nof explosive materials, as well as for the siting and design of explosive$\backslash$nfacilities. TNT equivalence is determined experimentally by several$\backslash$ndifferent types of tests, the most common of which include: plate$\backslash$ndent, ballistic mortar, trauzl, sand crush, and air blast. All of$\backslash$nthese tests do not necessarily measure the same output property of$\backslash$nthe sample explosive. As examples of this, some tests depend simply$\backslash$nupon the CJ pressure, some depend upon the PV work in the CJ zone$\backslash$nand in the Taylor wave behind the CJ plane, some are functions of$\backslash$nthe total work which includes that from secondary combustion in the$\backslash$nair mixing region of the fireball and are acutely effected by the$\backslash$nshape of the pressure-time profile of the wave. Some of the tests$\backslash$nincorporate systematic errors which are not readily apparent, and$\backslash$nwhich have a profound effect upon skewing the resultant data. Further,$\backslash$nsome of the tests produce different TNT Equivalents for the same$\backslash$nexplosive which are a function of the conditions at which the test$\backslash$nis run. This paper describes the various tests used, discusses the$\backslash$nresults of each test and makes detailed commentary on what the test$\backslash$nis actually measuring, how the results may be interpreted, and if$\backslash$nand how these results can be predicted by first principals based$\backslash$ncalculations. Extensive data bases are referred to throughout the$\backslash$npaper and used in examples for each point in the commentaries.},

The rate can be represented as r = 1.72 p0.164, with the regression rate, r, in cm/sec and pressure, p, in atmospheres. High-speed movies, 2000 frames per second, showed the combustion mode, droplet-particle formation, and images that were used to derive both surface and strand burn rates. Compaction of black powder meal was found to be in a linear logarithmic function of applied pressure, where samples of different moisture content formed a family of parallel lines. This same functional relationship was found when compressing grains of black powder and copper spheres. This similarity suggests the same physical processes are occurring in both materials where compaction results in plastic flow among a collection of close packed spheres.},

@techreport{Initiation1965,
abstract = {Initiation and detonation behavior of 13-micron ammonium perchlorate was studied at loading density 1.00 g/cm. Steady detonation velocities were determined experimentally at three diamet- rs and extrapolated to 3.75 ± 0. 15 mm/Vsec at infinite diameter. Calculations with the BKW equation of state gave 4. 25 mm/[Lsec--as good agreement as could be expected for a low-energy chlorine-containing explosive. By introducing 24-kbar flat-topped plane shocks into pellets of various lengths, it was determined that steady full-strength detonation was reached after about 15 mm travel. The growth of pressure in the accelerating wave was followed approximately by means of free-surface measurements on thin Plexiglas at the top surfaces of the pellets, and these measurements indicated the pressure to be 55 ± 10 kbar in the full-strength wave. Reducing the air pressure in the pressings to 5 microns left the build-up to detonation unaffected. The position of the shock Hugoniot for the pressings relative to the Hugoniot of the solid crystal is discussed in terms of heat production during collapse and possible reaction processes.},
address = {Washington},
annote = {For a shock wave to change into a detonation wave, an energy-producing chemical reaction must proceed fast enough to support the shock ahead of it. Many workers have assumed that attaining a high reaction rate depends on attaining high temperature; in fact, most have assumed the Arrhenius law. It has been shown that the average temperature of the material in a shocked granular explosive will barely suffice for high reaction rates in very insensitive materials, but for moderately sensitive secondary explosives it falls far short. Thus, the weak shock required to initiate granular PETN cannot raise more than a small fraction of the total mass of the pressing to the necessary tern- perature. Because of such instances, one is forced to postulate hut- spots, encompassing only a very small fraction of the mass in the pressing but containing the greater part of the energy.

When the blast is produced by explosives, pyrotechnics or unstable substances, the TNT equivalent model is widely used.

These equations, referred to here as characteristic curves, can be fitted by means of power equations, which depend on the TNT equivalent mass.

For those readers not concerned with turbomachinery design it might provide all the background they need. It is based on an introductory course taught at Durham University for some years. There are actually only three really difficult ideas in this book: understanding the cascade view (Chapter 1), velocity triangles (Chapter 2)and the concept of reaction (Chapter 6).

abstract = {A key issue in pulse detonation engine development is a low-energy initiation system that produces a short run-up distance to detonation and has reproducible shot-to-shot performance. Current practice in designing detonation initiation systems based on deflagration-to-detonation transition is highly empirical and no design guidelines are available. One of the objectives of the ONR MURI program on pulse detonation engines is developing an understanding of initiation which can be used in engine design. We report on a preliminary study of detonation initiation within a 38 mm diameter tube using spark ignition and a Schelkin spiral. A series of experiments have been performed with hydrogen, ethylene, and pro-pane fuels mixed with oxygen and diluents including argon, carbon dioxide, helium, and nitrogen. The time required for detonation development has been measured as a function of fuel type, equivalence ratio, initial pressure, diluent type, and diluent concentration. The relationship of the initiator performance to the detonation and deflagration characteristics of each mixture is examined.},

abstract = {Despite many computer based codes like CHEETAH, TIGER, RUBY, BKW, etc. the velocity of detonation for explosive mols. and explosive mixts. (formulations) is estd. by several empirical formulations. This article discusses various approaches for the estn. of the velocity of detonation by empirical math. equations. The formulation proposed by Kamlet in 1968 is the oldest one and it is confirmed to be more reliable by many subsequent researchers. The method proposed by Rothstein (1978), Xiong (1985), Stein (1990), Keshavarz (2006) are discussed and compared for conventional explosive mols. like RDX, HMX, TNT, PETN, and HNS. The values of the velocity of detonation for these mols. are found to be very close to each other. Further comparison of empirical math. formulations was carried out for 4 other explosive mols. of relatively recent origin (CL-20, FOX-7, TATB, and NTO). These mols. were selected as they were unknown at the time of the proposed formulations except that by Keshavarz (2006). For CL-20, the velocity of detonation by different methods is 9345.1 m/s (Kamlet), 9378.8 m/s (Rothstein), 9116.0 m/s (Xiong), 9383.7 m/s (Stein), and 9887.9 m/s (Keshavarz) resp. The method proposed by Keshavarz gives a higher value of the velocity of detonation than the others. For FOX-7, the values are 8636.6 m/s (Kamlet), 8733.3 m/s (Rothstein), 8766.1 m/s (Xiong), 8645.0 m/s (Stein), and 8245.3 m/s (Keshavarz) resp. In this case the Keshavarz approach gives a lower value of the velocity of detonation. For these mols., the results by the Xiong method is very close to that obtained by the Kamlet method. Deviation, as well as dispersion of the calcd. values by other methods, is on the high side. [on SciFinder(R)]},

annote = {Firefighters used the Emergency Response Guide Book devleoped and maintained by DOT, Transport Canada, and the Secretariat of Communications and Tranportation (Mexico). This guide does not provide any specific guidance on the handling of ammonium fertilizer and is specifically designed to address incidents occuring on the highway or railroad, not handling and processing in a fixed faciliy.

Storage of fertilizer grade ammonium nitratre (FGAN) met OSHA's construction requirements under 1910.109(i). In particular, the use of wooden bins to store FGAN was allowder under 1910.109(i) standard. Such construction likey facilitated the fire's spread between storage bins.

In addition to providing comments in response to the OSHA RFI, CSB reviewed guidance documents on FGAN from government and industry sources, finding that the only pre-WFC incident reference to the OSHA standard was in an EPA Chemical Safety Alert, “Explosion Hazard from AN,” from December 1997.423 In a letter to EPA, The Fertilizer Institute (TFI), a major trade association composed of fertilizer industry representatives, contended that the reference was inaccurate and that EPA therefore should remove it from its alert.424 Specifically, TFI said that the standard “was not applicable to facilities handling AN, unless the facility also handles an explosive or blasting agent.”425 This assertion, however, is incorrect; no part of the standard supports such a reading. As previously mentioned, 29 CFR 1910.109(i) clearly states that it applies to “. . . the storage of AN in the form of . . . prills including fertilizer grade . . .”426 Nonetheless, CSB finds that additional and well publicized guidance is needed to explain the applicability and provisions of the standard.

OSHA's Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals standard (29 CFR 1910.119) (known as the PSM standard) became effective in May 1992. The PSM standard states that it applies, in part, to “a process which involves a chemical at or above the specified threshold quantities listed in Appendix A [List of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, Toxics and Reactives] to this section.”451 Notably, FGAN is not on this list.

The EPA Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR Part 68, Subparts A through H) is intended to prevent and minimize the consequences of accidental releases of toxic or flammable substances. Enacted in 1996, the regulation required facilities to be compliant by 1999. In general, covered facilities are those with a substance on one of the Risk Management Program rule's two lists, one for toxic substances and one for flammable substances, in a quantity that meets or exceeds the threshold quantity for the substance. EPA noted that acute adverse health effects also could result from other inherent hazards, such as the flammability or high reactivity of the substance.518 Importantly, it stated that the phenomena associated with these hazards could be, for example, radiant heat from a chemical fire or blast waves from an explosion of a chemical. In its final decision however, EPA deferred listing these types of substances for lack of an adequate technical basis upon which to evaluate offsite consequences from unstable and reactive substances. However, FGAN is not on the list of regulated substances.

ATF regulates the manufacture, processing, use, distribution, and storage of explosive materials; ATF regulations include requirements for licensing, permitting, and recordkeeping and for storage of explosives.547 DOT regulates the transportation of explosives, and other agencies, such as OSHA, Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), Department of Defense (DOD), and International Maritime Organization, regulate certain aspects of the explosive industry.548 In its 1993 Federal Register notice, however, EPA stated that although explosives are regulated by federal, state, and local governments, these regulations do not uniformly address the issue of using appropriate hazard assessment techniques to identify hazards, designing and maintaining a safe facility, and minimizing the consequences of accidental releases when they do occur.},

The cellobiose-utilization phenotype can be conferred by mutations in the two cryptic operons, chb and asc. In this study, the cellobiose-utilization phenotype was conferred to E. coli by replacing the cryptic promoters of these endogenous operons with a constitutive promoter. Evolutionary adaptation of the engineered strain CP12CHBASC by repeated subculture in cellobiose-containing minimal medium led to an increase in the rate of cellobiose uptake and cell growth on cellobiose. An efficient cellobiose-metabolizing E. coli strain would be of great importance over glucose-metabolizing E. coli for a simultaneous saccharification and fermentation process, as the cost of the process would be reduced by eliminating one of the three enzymes needed to hydrolyze cellulose into simple sugars.},

abstract = {Ground vibration is a significant geohazard and has always been an important con- sideration in civil engineering design and construction. Vibrations can be caused naturally, by earthquakes, landslides, wave action, volcanoes, river waterfalls, and other actions (Huang et al., 2007). Vibrations can also be caused by people and technology, such as by road vehicles, trains, shipping, cargo handling, industrial machinery, and war (Sheng et al., 2006). Ground vibration can be caused by very loud noises, including by musical events, and by people marching or dancing. It can be caused by construction plant and operations. Levels of ground vibration that are strong enough to be felt by people are also strong enough to potentially damage structures and foundations. Damages can include excessive building settlement, liquefaction of sandy soils, slope instabil- ity, collapse of trenches, excavations, and tunnels, exposure of buried pipelines and other services, cracking of pipes, and serious discomfort to persons in workplaces, at home, or en route. Conversely, some construction operations deliberately vibrate the soil, such as vibro-coring methods. Other operations have ground vibration as an inevitable consequence, such as pile driving (White et al., 2002). Ground vibration is also a useful tool in exploration, and can be used to find buried minerals and objects of many kinds. Sometimes things go wrong, however. Jefferies and Been (2006) tell the story of a number of exploration trucks which pur- posely sent sound waves into the ground, as part of a survey for hydrocarbons. The sound waves liquefied the sandy ground on which the trucks were parked, leading to a slope failure and to the trucks sinking into the quicksand that they had created. This book brings together the main aspects of the practical knowledge of the art and science of ground vibration engineering. It describes techniques of measuring ground vibration, how to predict the likely maximum ground vibration levels during a structure's design life, how to predict its effects, how to design robust structures and foundations that will withstand design vibration levels, how to design construc- tion operations that use ground vibration effectively when needed, how to minimize it when not, and how to conduct a forensic investigation into ground vibration damage. Ground vibration is one of the expanding fields within civil engineering, and the practical knowledge and experiences recounted herein will likely help to encour- age much needed further research. Some of the topics of current and future work v vi Foreword are likely to include development of understanding of cyclic loading effects on soils, development of methods to accurately predict changes of soil stiffness and strength due to cyclic and dynamic loading, further development of safe geophysical methods of ground investigation, increased use of methods of controlled experimen- tation such as centrifuge modelling (Itoh et al., 2005), and further development of standards, codes of practice, and legislation. As well as distilling the Author's extensive experience, this book provides exten- sive reference to and commentaries on technical standards and codes of practice, and references to the key practical and academic references in the technical literature.},

abstract = {Ammonium nitrate (AN) is extensively used in the area of fertilizers and explosives. It is present as the major component in most industrial explosives. Its use as an oxidizer in the area of propellants, however, is not as extensive as in explosive compositions or gas generators. With the growing demand for environmental friendly chlorine free propellants, many attempts have been made of late to investigate oxidizers producing innocuous combustion products. AN, unlike the widely used ammonium perchlorate, produces completely ecofriendly smokeless products. Besides, it is one of the cheapest and easily available compounds. However, its use in large rocket motors is restricted due to some of its adverse characteristics like hygroscopicity, near room temperature phase transformation involving a volume change, and low burning rate (BR) and energetics. The review is an attempt to consolidate the information available on the various issues pertaining to its use as a solid propellant oxidizer. Detailed discussions on the aspects relating to phase modifications, decomposition chemistry, and BR and energetics of AN-based propellants, are presented. To make the review more comprehensive brief descriptions of the history, manufacture, safety, physical and chemical properties and various other applications of the salt are also included.

abstract = {The use of explosives for minerals extraction has always been a highly contentious area. The associated environmental impact is fre-quently an issue that curtails the sustainable development of many quarrying operations. However blasting is quite often the only eco-nomic means of mineral extraction. It is therefore vital for the in-dustry to do all that it can to reduce the vibration levels experienced at adjacent properties due to quarry blasting without imperilling the financial viability of the enterprise. Over the past twenty years we haven't seen any major development in initiation technology, with the last major development being the release of the Nonel detona-tion system in 1973. By more accurately controlling timing delays, electronic initiation detonator systems can increase rock fragmen-tation, lower vibration levels, reduce oversize; lessen the potential fly-rock. This translates into faster excavation times and improves downstream processing costs for the mining operation by increasing throughput, reducing crusher wear and lowering power consump-tion and maintenance costs. The purpose of this paper was to ex-amine the use of Electronic Detonators and their relevance in to the Slovenian mining industry. Povzetek: Uporaba minsko razstrelilnih sredstev pri pridobivanju mi-neralnih surovin je imela vedno poseben dvorezen pomen/vlogo.

RMZ-M{\&}G 2010, 57 lih v smislu trajnostnega razvoja. Kakor koli {\v{z}}e, uporaba metode razstreljevanja omogo{\v{c}}a velike ekonomske u{\v{c}}inke pri pridobiva-nju mineralnih surovin in je zato zelo za{\v{z}}elena. Prav tako ima po-seben pomen tudi za preostalo industrijo, {\v{s}}e posebej zaradi mo-{\v{z}}nosti zmanj{\v{s}}evanja dana{\v{s}}njih seizmi{\v{c}}nih vplivov pri miniranjih v kamnolomih brez posebnih finan{\v{c}}nih u{\v{c}}inkov na poslovanje.

As a test, it was used to record the velocity history of the back surface of 5 mm thick steel plates driven by the detonation products of PE4 charges of mass 15 - 60 g. A bare fibre tip, located 1 - 4 mm away from the target was used as the optical probe. Time resolution of 7 ns was achieved. The free surface velocity effects were interpreted in terms of the elastic-plastic model of steel, Chapman- Jouguet pressure was evaluated, and Gurney equations were applied to describe the motion of the steel plate. The measurement limitations of the PDV system are determined, applications for explosives research are discussed, and the upgrade pathway is recommended.},

@article{Tezduyar2008,
abstract = {We present an overview of how the arterial fluid mechanics problems can be modeled with the stabilized space–time fluid–structure interaction (SSTFSI) technique developed by the Team for Advanced Flow Simulation and Modeling (TAFSM). The SSTFSI technique includes the enhancements introduced recently by the TAFSM to increase the scope, accuracy, robustness and efficiency of this class of techniques. The SSTFSI technique is supplemented with a number of special techniques developed for arterial fluid mechanics modeling. These include a recipe for pre-FSI computations that improve the convergence of the FSI computations, using an estimated zero-pressure arterial geometry, and the sequentially coupled arterial FSI (SCAFSI) technique. The recipe for pre-FSI computations is based on the assumption that the arterial deformation during a cardiac cycle is driven mostly by the blood pressure. The SCAFSI technique, which was introduced as an approximate FSI approach in arterial fluid mechanics, is also based on that assumption. The need for an estimated zero-pressure arterial geometry is based on recognizing that the patient-specific image-based geometries correspond to time-averaged blood pressure values. In our arterial fluid mechanics modeling the arterial walls can be represented with the membrane or continuum elements, both of which are geometrically nonlinear, and the continuum element is made of hyperelastic (Fung) material. Test computations are presented for cerebral and abdominal aortic aneurysms, where the arterial geometries used in the computations are close approximations to the patient-specific image-based data.},

abstract = {Processing sourer opportunity crude oils leads to increased sulfur carryover to desulfurization and demercaptanization units in refineries worldwide. For this reason, the liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) treatment plant has an essential role in a refinery for meeting product sulfur specifications and for environmental compliance, regardless of the declining margin of the product itself.1, 2 The treatment process, often referred to as sweetening, involves the liquid/liquid extraction of the mercaptans (RSH) in LPG with a caustic solution, which is regenerated by oxidation with air in the presence of a liquid catalyst. For the refiner, it is important to reuse this regenerated caustic to the maximum extent to save on operating costs and to stay within product specifications. In general, operating parameters of LPG treatment units are not closely monitored by plant or process engineers. The reasons for this oversight include insufficient focus due to reduced profit margins and a lack of well-defined, practical insight into the process due to varying upstream conditions and challenging analysis of sour samples. The following case history addresses a solution to high sulfur levels in product LPG at the T{\"{u}}praş Izmit refinery in Turkey.

abstract = {When most experienced explosives engineers first observe a suppressed explosion they are convinced that there has been a misfire. Depending on the amount of water and the way it is contained, the overpressure can be reduced by a factor of ten, sometimes more than twenty (Salter and Parkes 1994). The number of fragments from shell cases can be cut by a factor of a hundred. Their velocities can be reduced by a factor of seven. Slugs from focal point charges are stopped within metres. Safety distances round magazines can be cut. The number of people evacuated from a bomb disposal site can be reduced. In June 1999, engineers from 33 EOD regiment saved an entire village in Kosovo from the detonation of a 2000 lb NATO bomb by using water bags. This paper outlines some of the physics behind the effects. Latent heat, fast external pressure rise, drag of fragments, momentum transfer, the speed of sound in gas-liquid mixtures and interference with the combustion of carbon are all involved but perhaps other mysteries still remain. Some practical details of the technique are discussed.},

abstract = {Air-blast parameters, including incident and reflected peak overpressures and impulses, and shock-front arrival times, are typically estimated for protective design using charts developed by Kingery and Bulmash. The charts underpredict incident and normally reflected peak overpressures and incident impulse near the face of the charge. Numerical analyses of detonations of spherical charges of trinitrotoluene in free air are performed using a verified and validated computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code to understand the shortcomings of current approaches for calculating incident and normally reflected overpressures and impulses, and for shock-front arrival time. New equations and design charts are proposed based on CFD calculations. Typical blast-resistant design practice in the United States, U.K., Australia, and Canada involves the use of empirical air-blast rela-tionships developed by Kingery and his co-workers (Kingery and Pannill 1964; Kingery 1966; Kingery and Bulmash 1984). These relationships are presented as charts for spherical free-air and hemispherical surface bursts of trinitrotoluene (TNT). The Kingery and Bulmash (KB) charts are based on high-order polynomials (Kingery and Bulmash 1984) that express incident and normally reflected overpressures, incident and normally reflected impulses, arrival time, and other blast-wave parameters as a function of scaled distance, Z, where Z ¼ R=W 1=3 , R is the distance from the center of the charge to the monitoring location (or standoff distance) and W is the charge weight (in units of mass).},

@article{Saif2017,
abstract = {We study experimentally fast flames and their transition to detonation in mixtures of methane, ethane, ethylene, acetylene, and propane mixtures with oxygen. Following the interaction of a detonation wave with a column of cylinders of varying blockage ratio, the experiments demonstrate that the fast flames established are Chapman-Jouguet deflagrations, in excellent agreement with the self-similar model of Radulescu et al. (2015). The experiments indicate that these Chapman-Jouguet deflagrations dynamically restructure and amplify into fewer stronger modes until the eventual transition to detonation. The transition length to a self-sustained detonation was found to correlate very well with the mixtures' sensitivity to temperature fluctuations, reflected by the {\$}\backslashchi{\$} parameter introduced by Radulescu, which is the product of the non-dimensional activation energy {\$}E{\_}a/RT{\$} and the ratio of chemical induction to reaction time {\$}t{\_}i/t{\_}r{\$}. Correlation of the measured DDT lengths determined that the relevant characteristic time scale from chemical kinetics controlling DDT is the energy release or excitation time {\$}t{\_}r{\$}. Correlations with the cell size also capture the dependence of the DDT length on {\$}\backslashchi{\$} for fixed blockage ratios.},

@inproceedings{Anderson2016,
abstract = {When assessing damage to a target, due to the blast produced from the detonation of a high explosive, it is necessary to determine not only the peak pressure produced by the blast but also the pressure as a function of time (pressure history). Pressure transducers are commonly used to determine pressure histories at discrete locations in an experiment. Often many transducers are required to accurately characterise the blast from a charge, since transducers only measure what happens at a particular point and there may be many variances and irregularities in the flow field. High speed video (HSV) tracking of shock waves is a complimentary approach to using transducers which provides continuous data from relatively close in to the charge out to large distances. The current work uses analytic equations presented by Sadek and Gottlieb [1] to calculate peak overpressure and characteristic decay time from shock tracking with HSV. By assuming that the overpressure history of the primary shock wave has the form of the modified Friedlander equation [2] , it is shown that shock wave tracking can be used successfully to calculate the overpressure history for the duration of the positive phase.},

@article{Chang2003,
abstract = {Sodium azide, used mainly as a preservative in aqueous laboratory reagents and biologic fluids and as a fuel in automobile airbag gas generants, has caused deaths for decades. Its exposure potential for the general population increases as the use of airbags increase. In order to characterize the known health effects of sodium azide in humans and the circumstances of their exposure, the authors conducted a systematic review of the literature from 1927 to 2002 on human exposure to sodium azide and its health effects. The most commonly reported health effect from azide exposure is hypotension, almost independent of route of exposure. Most industrial exposures are by inhalation. Most laboratory exposures or suicide attempts are by ingestion. Most of the reported cases involved persons working in laboratories. The time between exposure and detection of hypotension can predict outcome. Fatal doses occur with exposures of {\textgreater}or=700 mg (10 mg/kg). Nonlethal doses ranged from 0.3 to 150 mg (0.004 to 2 mg/kg). Onset of hypotension within minutes or in less than an hour is indicative of a pharmacological response and a benign course. Hypotension with late onset ({\textgreater}1 hour) constitutes an ominous sign for death. All individuals with hypotension for more than an hour died. Additional health effects included mild complaints of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, temporary loss of vision, palpitation, dyspnea, or temporary loss of consciousness or mental status decrease. More severe symptoms and signs included marked decreased mental status, seizure, coma, arrhythmia, tachypnea, pulmonary edema, metabolic acidosis, and cardiorespiratory arrest. The signs and symptoms from lower exposures ({\textless}700 mg) are physiological responses at the vascular level and those at or above are toxicological responses at the metabolic level. There is no specific antidote for sodium azide intoxication. Recommended preventive measures for sodium azide exposure consist of education of people at high risk, such as laboratory workers, regarding its chemical properties and toxicity, better labeling of products containing sodium azide, and strict enforcement of laboratory regulations and access control.},

N is the number of moles of gaseous detonation products per gram of explosive, M is the average weight of these gases, Q is the chemical energy of the detonation re-action (-tlHo per gram), and PO is the initial density. Values of N, M, and Q may be estimated from the H2O-C02 arbitrary decomposition assumption, so that the calculations require no other imput information than the explosive's elemental composition, heat of formation, and loading density. Detonation pressures derived in this manner correspond quite closely to values predicted by a computer code known as RUBY, which employs the most recent parameters and covolume factors with the Kistiakowsky-Wilson equation of state.},

abstract = {This paper uses the thermochemical behaviour of reacting species to differentiate between the combustion of gas phase and condensed phase detonation products in the fireball of an explosion. Experiments were carried out involving the detonation 15. g charges of C-4 and Detasheet-C explosives in a closed vessel. The initial partial pressure of oxygen in the vessel was varied in order to control the extent of the secondary afterburn reactions, and the total heat release was measured using the calorimeter that contained the closed vessel. A simple model that independently describes the evolution of heat from the gas phase and condensed phase detonation products as a function of oxygen consumption was developed, and was used to show that condensed phase products react much more effectively in the fireball than gas phase reactions, because the transport properties of particulates entrained in a turbulent flow gives them an advantage when it comes to the manner in which they mix with the surrounding air. An additional set of trials employing the entrainment of an external combustible material further confirms the importance of particle combustion in explosive fireballs. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

abstract = {{\{}{\~{}}{\}}An experimental investigation was conducted to obtain direct measurements of side-on overpressures from spherical charges of six different Jiigh explo- sives at small scaled distances ranging from 0.74 to 3.5 ft/lb ' . The pressure-time recordings of the incident airblast waves were processed to obtain peak side-on overpressures, shock wave arrival times, side-on impulses, and positive durations. Comparisons of the test data were made with standard blast curves for these four parameters. The side-on overpressure and arrival time data from the TNT tests are in excellent agreement with the standard curves. The impulse and duration data show that at scaled distances less than 3 ft/lb ', the standard curves are not as well defined as those for pressure and arrival time. 'TNT equivalencies for each of the six explosives were determined using the standard pressure and impulse curves, as well as the actual TNT test data obtained. These results indicate that the pressure based TNT equivalency at small scaled distances for some of the explosives tested can be significantly different than that based on the heat of detonation.},

@article{Karlos2016,
abstract = {A growing interest for the design of structures to sustain blast-induced loads has been observed in recent years as a result of the worldwide rise of terrorist bombing attacks. The blast loading is usually characterized by a sudden increase in the pressure followed by an exponential decay. The parameters of this pressure pulse are essential for design and can be found in various blast design manuals available in the open literature. One of the most widely used sources is a technical report by Kingery–Bulmash, which provides values for many blast parameters in diagrams and polynomial form. However, it does not include an equation for calculating the blast wave decay coefficient, necessary for constructing the pressure–time history of an explosion at a certain point. In this study, a review of the technical literature that contains expressions for the blast pressure decay coefficient is performed, and relevant comparisons have been made. New equations describing the decay coefficient of the Friedlander equation for both incident and reflected cases for free-air and surface bursts are proposed. These equations express the decay coefficient in terms of the scaled distance and are not valid for close-in detonations. They are entirely based on the Kingery–Bulmash data, and their accuracy is satisfactorily checked against new experimental results and their trends assessed through a sensitivity analysis. Accordingly, the positive phase of the pressure–time curve at a point can be reliably and efficiently generated.},

abstract = {Over the last decades considerable attention has been raised on the behaviour of engineering structures under blast or impact loading. The use of explosives by terrorist groups around the world that target civilian buildings and other structures is becoming a growing problem in modern societies. Explosive devices have become smaller in size and more powerful than some years ago, leading to increased mobility of the explosive material and larger range effects. Usually the casualties from such a detonation are not only related to instant fatalities as a consequence of the direct release of energy, but mainly to structural failures that might occur and could result in extensive life loss. Famous examples of such cases are the bombing attacks at the World Trade Center in 1993 and on the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995. In both of these incidents, structural failure, including glass breakage, resulted in far more victims and injuries than the blast wave itself. After the events of the 11th September 2001 that led to the collapse of the World Trade Center in New York it was realized that civilian and government buildings, as well as areas with high people concentration (metro and train stations, means of mass transportation, stadiums etc.) are becoming potential bombing targets of terrorist groups. Since most engineering structures are vulnerable to such type of loading scenarios, a guide should be introduced to the designer in order to guarantee structural integrity even under those extreme situations.},

Lengthy derivations have been avoided because reference books could be used for that purpose. Main equations to remember have been provided straight away with relevant explanation. The main concentration in this chapter is on introducing some basic concepts, discussion on low speed flow past airfoils and finite wings, forces and moments that are developed on these bodies due to air flow and a brief exposure to some of the methods of analyzing these flows.},

abstract = {Thesis: Significant and dangerous misconceptions exist concerning the potential use of smokeless propellants as the main explosive charge in a large vehicle borne improvised explosive devices (VBIED). The unrestricted availability of smokeless powder, coupled with a lack of awareness and appreciation for its destructive potential, constitute a considerable blind spot available for exploitation by violent extremist organizations and individuals. Discussion: Conventional explosive materials remain the most probable terrorist attack scenario. Violent extremist groups continue to explore innovative attack options that take advantage of overlooked vulnerabilities inherent to the civilian sector. The Federal government defines smokeless propellants as low explosive materials designed to burn rather than detonate. This orthodox view of smokeless powder allows these propellants to remain virtually unregulated by the Federal government. The results of previous independent and government sponsored studies along with the results of preliminary live fire tests conducted in support of this report provide compelling evidence that smokeless powder is capable of unconfined detonation. The live fire tests were preformed to determine if unconfined propellants are capable of detonation when initiated with a commercial blasting cap. These tests, while greatly limited in scope, provide sufficient data to challenge orthodox notions of smokeless powder and emphasize the necessity for additional testing and research. The test results validate a fundamental, and often overlooked, distinction between the manner in which smokeless powder is designed to react (deflagrate) to a given stimuli (ammunition primer) and the manner in which it is capable of reacting (detonating) to unintended stimuli (detonator). This important distinction is commonly ignored or not understood and is the essence of this report. Conclusion: Smokeless propellants represent some degree of threat to the security of the homeland. The government has thus far not assessed the extent of this threat. A valid threat assessment can only be accomplished through comprehensive testing and research. Political debate and expert consultation will not achieve a deep understanding of the potential threat. Smokeless powder may represent one piece of low hanging fruit waiting for some al-Qa'ida type to pick.},

@phdthesis{Zagreba2003,
abstract = {Fragmentation is a major concern of any blasting operation. Information on the degree and size distribution of fragments within a blasted rock mass is essential for efficient rock loading and crushing operations. Detailed literature review shows that majority of the previous researchers estimated blast fragmentation by considering four basic variables, i.e. rock properties, explosive properties, drilling pattern and bench geometry. However, when considering the effect of burden on rock fragmentation, simplified assumptions were made and its variability along the bench height was often ignored. In reality, because of the non-uniform burden along the bench height, the actual powder factor in the front row of holes could differ significantly from the one estimated assuming uniform burden. This will be more so if the bench is highly irregular and has significantly different toe and crest burdens. Ignoring this fact may result in a poor fit of the existing fragmentation models for the actual data. Research in this thesis demonstrates this fact and the results underscore the importance of considering the true bench profile for the blast fragmentation analysis. For the present work, the irregularity of the bench profile and the resulting nonuniform burden was estimated using the laser profiling technique. A new rock fragmentation model, FRAGM, which considers the variability in burden, was developed and verified by comparing with actual blast results from a West Virginian limestone quarry. The developed model can be used as a quick and reliable means to predict or assess the rock fragmentation before or after a blast.},

This paper investigated the effects of process parameters on depth of cut in abrasive waterjet cutting of cast iron. Four different process parameters were undertaken for this study; water pressure, nozzle traverse speed, abrasive m ass flow rate and standoff distance. Experiments were conducted in varying these parameters for cutting cast iron using abrasive waterjet cutting process. The influence of these process parameters on depth of cut has been studied based on the experimental results.In order to correctly select the process parameters, an empirical model for the prediction of depth of cut in abrasive waterjet cutting of cast iron is developed using regression analysis. This developed model has been verified with the experimental results that reveal a high applicability of the model within the experimental range used.},

abstract = {Previous studies have shown that the playing of thunderstorm recordings during an open-field task elicits fearful or anxious responses in adult beagles. The goal of our study was to apply this open-field test to assess sound-induced behaviors in Labrador retrievers drawn from a pool of candidate-improvised explosive devices (IEDs)-detection dogs. Being robust to fear-inducing sounds and recovering quickly is a critical requirement of these military working dogs. This study presented male and female dogs, with 3 minutes of either ambient noise (days 1, 3, and 5), recorded thunderstorm (day 2), or gunfire (Day 4) sounds in an open-field arena. Behavioral and physiological responses were assessed and compared with control (ambient noise) periods. An observer blinded to sound treatment analyzed video records of the 9-minute daily test sessions. Additional assessments included measurement of distance traveled (activity), heart rate, body temperature, and salivary cortisol concentrations. Overall, there was a decline in distance traveled and heart rate within each day and over the 5-day test period, suggesting that dogs habituated to the open-field arena. Behavioral postures and expressions were assessed using a standardized rubric to score behaviors linked to canine fear and anxiety. These fear/anxiety scores were used to evaluate changes in behaviors after exposure to a sound stressor. Compared with control periods, there was an overall increase in fear/anxiety scores during thunderstorm and gunfire sound stimuli treatment periods. Fear/anxiety scores were correlated with distance traveled and heart rate. Fear/anxiety scores in response to thunderstorm and gunfire were correlated. Dogs showed higher fear/anxiety scores during periods after the sound stimuli compared with control periods. In general, candidate IED-detection Labrador retrievers responded to sound stimuli and recovered quickly, although dogs stratified in their response to sound stimuli. Some dogs were robust to fear/anxiety responses. The results suggest that the open-field sound test may be a useful method to evaluate the suitability of dogs for IED-detection training.},

Dogs (N=27) were submitted twice to environmental challenges (challenge 1 and 2, 20 days in-between) composed of social (training), visual (mobile toy car) and auditory (air blast) stimuli. Cortisol levels decreased back to the baseline after the second challenge. The behavioral observations showed that these MWD were more active, and presented less stereotypic behaviors (pacing, manipulation of the environment) during both visual challenges, whereas half low posture was observed during the first but not during the second visual challenge. The present study shows that this group of MWD still has an adaptation capacity to an environmental challenge (return to baseline of the cortisol levels, a higher posture during the second than at the first challenge). These results are encouraging and indicate that the dogs might have a diminished welfare (i.e. stereotypic behaviors), but are not chronically stressed. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {This study experimentally examined the explosive fragmentation of thin ceramic tubes using pulsed power. A thin ceramic tube was threaded on a thin copper wire, and high voltage was applied to the wire using a pulsed power generator. This melted the wire and the resulting vapor put pressure on the ceramic tube, causing it to fragment. We examined the statistical properties of the fragment mass distribution. The cumulative fragment mass distribution obeyed the double exponential or power-law with exponential decay. Both distributions agreed well with the experimental data. We also found that the weighted mean fragment mass was scaled by the multiplicity. This result was similar to impact fragmentation, except for the crossover point. Finally, we obtained universal scaling for fragmentation, which is applicable to both impact and explosive fragmentation.},

Originally it was obtained from the dirt floors of stables, sheep pens, pigeon houses, caverns, and even peasants' cottages; any place manure and refuse accumulated in soil under dry conditions. When these sources became inadequate to meet demand it was manufactured on saltpeter plantations, located in dry climates, where piles of dirt, limestone, and manure were allowed to stand for three to five years while soil microbes oxidized the nitrogen to nitrate—an example of early bioengineering. Extensive deposits of sodium nitrate were mined in the Atacama Desert in northern Chile from 1830 until the mid 1920s when the mines were displaced by the Haber–Ostwald process.},

Defence Research and Development Canada - Valcartier (DRDC-V) and the Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO) are collaborating to assess the potential of nanometric aluminum powders in explosive compositions. Various plastic-bonded explosives (PBXs) and TNT-based formulations have been developed to compare ultrafine and conventional micron-sized aluminum. Explosive performance was determined by VoD measurements and plate dent depth tests. The study was also complemented by air-blast tests to evaluate the difference in energy release in the far-field. It was found that for PBX compositions, no significant differences were observed between formulations containing micron-sized and nanometric aluminum. For mixes of TNT and aluminum, an improvement was noted in the velocity of detonation and in plate dent depths using ultrafine aluminum. Aquarium tests were run on TNT/Al blends to confirm the improvement observed, to evaluate the relative performance of the different sizes of aluminum and to qualify the behaviour of the aluminum in such an explosive.},

Energy versus drop weight and test height curves show that momentum considerations are crucial over large test ranges in studies of impact sensitivity.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2008, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Belgrade. The paper considers statistical aspects of high explosive warhead fragmentation. The modeling of fragment mass distribution is of great importance for determination of fragmenting warhead efficiency. Seven relevant theoretical fragment mass distribution models are reviewed: the Mott, the generalized Mott, the Grady, the generalized Grady, the lognormal, the Weibull and the Held distribution. Comparison of these models with representative experimental database of 30 fragmenting projectiles has shown, generally, a very good correspondence between theoretical models and experimental data. The goodness of fit analysis has indicated that the generalized Mott, the generalized Grady and the Weibull distribution enable the best description of experimental fragment mass distribution data. Further comparison of these models based on the median analysis prefers the generalized Grady distribution, and its bimodal characteristic can be physically justified. The suggested theoretical fragment mass distribution law can be applied in a complex fragmenting projectile efficiency simulation model.},

@article{Klopcic1996,
abstract = {A fundamental step in evaluation of warhead performance is the characterization of fragments emitted during warhead detonation. The emitted fragments must be captured, a process made difficult by their high initial speeds; however, the capture must be "soft" to avoid breaking the fragments into pieces, thus changing the mass distribution. Customary techniques involve the capture in sheets of soft building material ("Celotex"), an expensive technique. As a result, a test series customarily consists of only a few rounds.
This report presents a new technique which uses hay for the capture and recovery of fragments for those cases in which the data required include the total distribution of masses, but not the partial distributions by angle. This capture technique does not preserve angular information after capture. On the other hand, the use of hay as a stopping medium provides exceptional savings in materials and labor. As a result, a test series was run at approximately 20{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}} of the cost of a comparable series employing the customary "Celotex" technique.},

abstract = {An electric drive is the electromechanical system that converts electrical energy to mechanical motion. Being a part of automatic equipment, it acts together with the driven object, such as a machine tool, metallurgical, chemical, or flying apparatus, domestic or medical device. Electric drives area includes applications in computers and peripherals, motor starters, transportation (electric and hybrid electric vehicles, subway, etc.), home appliances, textile and paper mills, wind generation systems, air-conditioning and heat pumps, compressors and fans, rolling and cement mills, and robotics. This book is intended primarily for the secondary-level and university-level learners of an electromechanical profile, including the bachelor and master students majored in electrical engineering and mechatronics. It will help also technicians and engineers of respective specialities. Contemporary applications make high demands of modern drive technology with regard to dynamic performance, speed and positioning accuracy, control range, torque stability, and overload capacity. Control of electrical motors always was in the highlight of inventers and designers of mechanisms, machines, and transport equipment. As a rule, any mechanism is infinitely complex. Oſten, its behavior is vague, and its reaction on influences and disturbances is unforeseen. To a considerable degree, this concerns the electric drive. Nevertheless, a specialist should take into account the main laws and regularities of both the driving and the driven objects during maintenance design, and study his applications. To this aim, we pick out the traditional approach at which a complex system is divided in simple portions. Then, we examine the basic elements of the driving system, the typical models and features of its components, starting from the conditionally rigid and ideally linear details and finishing by the elastic distributed, non-linear, and non-stationary ones},

abstract = {Director Ammunition and Explosives Regulation (DAER) requires a quantitative risk anal- ysis to support decisions to grant risk-based licenses to munitions facilities. The software application that provides the required analysis is the Safety Assessment For Explosives Risk (SAFER). DAER requested Directorate Materiel Group Operational Research team to research and analyze two issues, which were the practical interpretation of the uncer- tainty of SAFER's risk assessment, and the accuracy of SAFER's risk assessment. SAFER transparently handles uncertainties and rigorously shows how they affect SAFER's risk estimator, which is the expected number of fatalities per year. However, investigative cal- culations revealed two important sources of bias: (1) the use of numerical proxies, and (2) the assumption that the conditional probability of fatality has a lognormal distribution. The elimination of these sources of bias is recommended, thereby reducing the likelihood that a risk-based license will be rejected because of an inadvertent bias in SAFER's risk estimator.},

abstract = {Six test firings of large improvised explosive devices were carried out. The principal objectives of the firings were to measure the physical effects of the explosions upon representative objects placed nearby and to recover any chemical traces deposited on these objects. The results are intended for use as an aid in determining the approximate size and type of an explosive employed in terrorist attacks. Three 454 kg charges of a mixture of calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN) fertilizer and sugar, and three 2268 kg charges of a similar mixture, all confined in cylindrical steel containers were fired. Each charge was surrounded by 19 road signs mounted on posts and four vehicles, to act as witness materials. The analysis of aqueous swab extracts taken from the witness materials after firing showed the recovery of nitrate, ammonium and low levels of glucose. No sucrose was detected. Nitrate was usually recovered in greater quantities than ammonium and recovery generally decreased with increasing distance from the charges in any given direction. Quantities recovered from objects placed at the same distance in different directions varied considerably. Patterns of physical damage to the witness materials could be discerned according to their distance from the charge and the size of the charge. The velocities of detonation and air blast effects were measured.},

A range of the newest and advanced quantitative models is presented hereby introducing recent advances in wetting and nucleation modelling, and theory describing granule growth behaviour. The different bonding mechanisms and the strength of liquid bonded particles are emphasised and recent advances in simulation of wet granule breakage is reviewed. Further, some of the more advanced coalescence models are introduced with primary focus on class I models accounting for coalescence of non-deformable as well as deformable granules. The text is aimed at undergraduate university or engineering-school students working in the field chemical and biochemical engineering as well as particle technology. Newly graduated as well as experienced engineers may also find relevant new information as emphasis is put on the newest scientific discoveries and proposals presented in the last few years of scientific publications. It is the hope that the present text will provide a complete and up-to-date image of how far modern granulation theory has come, and also further provide the reader with qualitative rules of thumb that may be essential when working with granulation processes. The comprehensive literature list may also hopefully be an inspiration for further reading.},

Best aspects of previously used classification systems are incorporated. 2. It is based on properties of rick materials and rock masses. 3. It is functional (it can be applied to solutions of practical engineering problems). 4. Standard terms are employed. 5. A rating system is provided to weigh the relative importance of various classification parameters. The geological parameters which the engineer needs for his design are specified and the reasons therefore are explained. The functional feature of the geomechanics classification is demonstrated by applying it to the selection of primary support in tunnel design. The proposed classification system is based on a detailed study of all existing major rock classifications, on personal discussions with many overseas specialists in this field and on experience gained in numerous visits to construction sites aboard and in South Africa, where various classification systems has been used.},

A diligent attempt has been made to scrutinize black powder and the charcoal it contains as fully as possible, utilizing modern testing techniques and various analytical chemical procedures. Although the tests performed are well established, their application to define a porous propellant represents a new point of view for investigating structure. From S.E.M. microphotographs and compaction studies, it is suggested that the pressing action used to make black powder results in plastic flow that produces a conglomerate and cohesive mass containing a matrix of inter-connecting passageways. The degree of openness of black powder grains and, in particular, internal surface area, pore volume, internal free volume, and density were all found to be related to burn rate. Thermodynamic calculations were cited that relate computed theoretical values to experimentally determined quantities. Closed bomb data embrace more than one combustion mode and as such do not directly relate to bulk values. From this interrogation, chemical and physical properties were related to combustion phenomena. As work progressed it became evident that material produced by the INdiana Army Ammunition Plant will be, or has become, the most successfully characterized black powder produced in the United States.},

This data originates from weapons tests and blast studies to assess the effect of blast overpressure on structures and people. This data provides some guidance on the possible effects of mine explosions on miners.

Peak overpressure Maximum wind speed Effect on structures Effect on the human body 1 psi 38 mph Window glass shatters Light injuries from fragments occur 2 psi 70 mph Moderate damage to houses (windows and doors blown out and severe damage to roofs) People injured by flying glass and debris 3 psi 102 mph Residential structures collapse Serious injuries are common, fatalities may occur 5 psi 163 mph Most buildings collapse Injuries are universal, fatalities are widespread 10 psi 294 mph Reinforced concrete buildings are severely damaged or demolished Most people are killed 20 psi 502 mph Heavily built concrete buildings are severely damaged or demolished Fatalities approach 100{\%} The human body can survive relatively high blast overpressure without experiencing barotrauma. A 5 psi blast overpressure will rupture eardrums in about 1{\%} of subjects, and a 45 psi overpressure will cause eardrum rupture in about 99{\%} of all subjects. The threshold for lung damage occurs at about 15 psi blast overpressure. A 35-45 psi overpressure may cause 1{\%} fatalities, and 55 to 65 psi overpressure may cause 99{\%} fatalities. (Glasstone and Dolan, 1977; TM 5-1300, 1990) Table 1 also shows the maximum wind speed associated with the given overpressure. In mine explosions, as in war-related explosions, it is the blast wind resulting from the blast overpressure that leads to injuries and fatalities. The human body may be thrown},

Bridgman's' method and calculating the states off the isotherms from known thermodynamic relations for isentropes and reflected shock states. A serious deficiency in this approach, however, was the lack of equations of state at much higher pressures than those obtainable from isothermal compressibility experiments. To extend the equations of state from 10 to 50 GPa in pressure, Walsh and Christian2 and Goranson et a1.3 developed a technique for determining the locus of single-shocked states (the Hugoniot locus) within this pressure regime and, again using thermodynamic relations, for calculating states off the Hugoniot. Many scientists and technicians have been involved in determination of Hugoniot data at LASL since then. This volume is a compendium of the data they have accumulated from over 5000 experiments.},

abstract = {Understanding the shock compression of geological materials is important for many applications, and is particularly important to the mining industry. During blast mining the response to shock loading determines the wave propagation speed and resulting fragmentation of the rock. The present work has studied the Hugoniot of two geological materials; Lake Quarry Granite and Gosford Sandstone. For samples of these materials, the composition was characterised in detail. The Hugoniot of Lake Quarry Granite was predicted from this information as the material is fully dense and was found to be in good agreement with the measured Hugoniot. Gosford Sandstone is porous and undergoes compaction during shock loading. Such behaviour is similar to other granular material and we show how it can be described using a P-a compaction model.},

During the course of an exten, sive study of the sensitivity of nitromethane, this laboratory has developed a modification of the card-gap test, which, when coupled with the Bruceton «up.and-down» experimental technique has been found to yield dependable and very reproducible results. A systematic evaluation of the effect of sensitizers and desensitizers has been a primary aim of the program. The more rigorous « confinement test », which, has been developed in this laboratory to assess potential hazards of those liquid systems which yield negative results at zero gap on the card test but which still show evidence of considerable release of energy, yields semi quanth tative data for the ranking of these systems. Temperature has been found to have a marked influence on the sensitivity level of the liquid systems investigated.},

A knowledge of hydrology is fundamental to water and environmental professionals (engineers, scientists and decision makers) in such tasks as the design and operation of water resources, wastewater treatment, irrigation, flood defence, navigation, pollution control, hydropower, ecosystem modelling, etc. This is an introductory book on hydrology and written for undergraduate students in civil and environmental engineering, environmental science and geography. The aim of this book is to provide a concise coverage of key contents in hydrology that is easy to access through the Internet. The book covers the fundamental theories on hydrological cycle (water balance, atmospheric water, subsurface water, surface water), precipitation analysis, evaporation and evapotranspiration processes, infiltration, ground water movement, hydrograph analysis, rainfall runoff modelling (unit hydrograph), hydrological flow routing, measurements and data collection, hydrological statistics and hydrological design. The text has been written in a concise format that is integrated with the relevant graphics. There are many examples to further explain the theories introduced. The questions at the end of each chapter are accompanied by the corresponding answers and full solutions. A list of recommended reading resources is provided in the appendix for readers to further explore the interested hydrological topics},

abstract = {It is well known that some liquid explosives can detonate at either high or low rates depending primarily on the strength of the initiating stimulus. Earlier experimental and theoretical work conducted at the Bureau and elsewhere suggests that inhomogeneities in the form of cavities play an important role in the initiation of both high- and low- velocity detonations. A recent experimental program has been carried out in an effort to define more clearly features that are characteristic of low-velocity detonation in liquids. Photographic studies of the growth, propagation, and stability of low-velocity detonations in 50/50 nitroglycerin-ethylene glycol dinitrate (NG-EGDN) have yielded a sim- ple physical model describing the qualitative features of the phenomena. This model suggests that precursor wall waves with associated rare- factions generate fluid cavitation ahead of the chemical reaction zone. These cavities then serve as incipient reaction centers with initiation occurring when they are overtaken by the high-pressure field associ- ated with the reaction zone. Correlating experiments using air-filled hemispherical cavities located on the free surface of fluids as welJ as air-filled bubbles in a bulk of the liquid explosive indicate that liquid microjetting may be responsible for the initiation of reaction within
the cavities.},

abstract = {A boiling liquid, expanding vapor explosion (BLEVE) occurs when a pressure vessel containing a superheated liquid undergoes a catastrophic failure, resulting in a violent vaporization of the liquid. The exposure of a pressure vessel to a fire is a classic scenario that can result in a BLEVE. The thermomechanical exergy of a pressure vessel's contents provides - by definition - an upper bound on the work that can be performed by the system during the explosion. By fixing the values of ambient pressure and temperature (i.e., the dead state), exergy can be interpreted as another thermodynamic property. This rigorous and unambiguous definition makes it ideal to estimate the maximum energy of explosions. The numerical value of exergy depends on the definition of the dead state. In this paper we examine the effect of different definitions for the dead state on the explosion energy value. We consider two applications of this method: the contribution of the vapor head-space to the explosive energy as a function of the fractional liquid fill of the vessel, and the effect of the vessel burst pressure.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {A semiempirical model was developed for the treatment of the Mach stem region of a nuclear airburst. This model predicts the conditions that would be observed by an aircraft or missile as well as the limits of this region in space. The model is based upon current shock theory. Where three shock theory fails to accurately predict physical reality, new relations are developed or empirical data is used. Specifically, this model predicts the path of the triple point, the overpressure, dynamic pressure, time of arrival, and direction of the shock impulse above the ground. An explanation of the development of each prediction is made and compared to actual nuclear or high explosive test data. Additionally, a comparison is made between conventional Mach stem modeling and this model. Unique to this model is a method of predicting the variation of pressure with altitude above the ground. For low scaled heights of burst, the overpressure found at an altitude of 20/pereen of the triple point height is greater than that on the ground. In addition, the overpressure measured just below the triple point is found to be only 60 percent of the ground overpressure scaled to altitude. This prediction is radically different than conventional ground overpressures scaled to atmospheric pressure at altitude. The predictions made by this model are verified by nuclear and high explosive test data.},

@article{Donahue2013,
abstract = {Afterburning occurs when fuel-rich explosive detonation products react with oxygen in the surrounding atmosphere. This energy release can further contribute to the air blast, resulting in a more severe explosion hazard particularly in confined scenarios. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the influence of the products equation of state (EOS) on the prediction of the efficiency of trinitrotoluene (TNT) afterburning and the times of arrival of reverberating shock waves in a closed chamber. A new EOS is proposed, denoted the Afterburning (AB) EOS. This EOS employs the JWL EOS in the high pressure regime, transitioning to a Variable-Gamma (VG) EOS at lower pressures. Simulations of three TNT charges suspended in a {\{}{\$}{\}}{\{}{\$}{\}}26{\{}$\backslash${\}},{\{}$\backslash${\}}hbox {\{}{\{}{\}}m{\{}{\}}{\}}{\^{}}3{\{}{\$}{\}}{\{}{\$}{\}} 26 m 3 explosion chamber were performed. When compared to numerical results using existing methods, it was determined that the Afterburning EOS delays the shock arrival times giving better agreement with the experimental measurements in the early to mid time. In the late time, the Afterburning EOS roughly halved the error between the experimental measurements and results obtained using existing methods. Use of the Afterburning EOS for products with the Variable-Gamma EOS for the surrounding air further significantly improved results, both in the transient solution and the quasi-static pressure. This final combination of EOS and mixture model is recommended for future studies involving afterburning explosives, particularly those in partial and full confinement.},

A comparison between MT and MTV combustion has been carried out with emphasis on investigating the effect of Viton on the combustion characteristics. The effect of air on MTV combustion has also been investigated for two possible MTV-air combustion models. A chemical kinetic mechanism with 18 reactions and 17 species, has been used to study the time evolution of reacting MT mixtures, accounting for finite-rate elementary reactions as well as performing sensitivity analysis with respect to reaction rates. Three different variations of the kinetic scheme have been studied and their effects on combustion products and flame temperature have been examined. Kinetic analysis has been repeated for three pyrotechnic compositions that are commonly used in flare and rocket motor igniter formulations.},

abstract = {Measurements of the times of arrival of the primary shock produced by the explosion of a nominal 20 tn propane-oxygen mixture have been analysed to provide the variation of the peak hydrostatic overpressure as a function of the distance. The results have been scaled to those for a charge of unit mass at normal temperature and pressure, based on the masses of the propane and oxygen and of the propane alone. The scaled results are compared with those produced by the explosion of a hemispherical unit mass of TNT to previde the TNT equivalence factor as a function of overpressure and distance. For overpressures greater than 1 atm there a strong dependence on the distance from the centre of the explosion, but at lower overpressures the equivalence factor have almost constant values of 0.55 for the propane- oxygen mixture and 1.95 for the propane alone. The significance of these findings, in relationship to vapour cloud explosions and boiling liquid expanding vapor explosions; is discussed.},

@techreport{Foltz2009,
abstract = {Pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) is a relatively sensitive explosive used in many electroexplosive devices as well as in medicine. Of primary interest to LLNL is its use in items such as exploding bridgewire (EBW) detonators and exploding bridge foil initiators (EFI). In these devices the crystalline powder is pressed into a granular, low-density compact that can be initiated by an exploding wire or foil. The long-term stability of this pressed compact is of interest to weapon stockpile lifetime prediction studies. Key points about potential aging mechanisms can be summarized as follows: (1) There are a number of factors that can contribute to PETN instability. These include particle size, polymorphic phase transitions, crystal structure, impurities, moisture, occlusions, chemical incompatibility and biological (microorganism) action. of these factors the most important for long-term aging of high surface area powders used in detonators appears to be that of particle size growth. (2) There is a great deal of literature on the thermal degradation kinetics of PETN, unfortunately much of it with little bearing on ambient temperature aging during long-term storage. PETN is very stable with respect to thermal decomposition. Low-temperature thermal studies have not revealed evidence of chemical degradation products in archived PETN. Data extrapolated to 30 C predicts a half-life of 12 million years. (3) Moisture seems to lower the activation energy for and accelerate the decomposition of PETN. (4) External drivers affecting stability include temperature, moisture, radiation fields, and stress, while internal drivers include residual solvents, and impurities. Temperature affects kinetic processes of crystal growth such as adsorption, desorption, and diffusion rates of molecules on the surface of PETN crystals. A low-level radiation field may induce unexpected changes in the chemical makeup of PETN and its homologue impurities. Stress at high pressure points caused by crystalline surface irregularities may cause a decrease in surface area over time due to smoothing of contact points and sintering. PETN has been found to contain a number of impurities, including homologues, pentaerythryl ethers with a mixture of hydroxyl and nitrate functional groups, and organic salts, that can alter its physical and chemical properties. (5) The processes of sublimation/recrystallization and surface diffusion are important processes that can cause changes in PETN crystal morphology, particle size distribution and specific surface area. Sublimation feeds a process called Ostwald ripening, which involves the spontaneous growth of larger crystals from those of smaller size. This process proceeds with age regardless of storage conditions unless the crystals are treated to retard growth. The coarsening mechanisms include Ostwald ripening, 'sintering', and surface diffusion. The latter has not been experimentally observed, but a molecular modeling approach has attempted to investigate this phenomenon theoretically. (6) Threshold test fire, particle size distribution, specific surface area, thermal analysis, chemical analysis, powder compact specific surface area and density are approaches that have been used in the attempt to assess changes attributable to aging of PETN, with varying results. The biggest problem lies in the aging mechanism itself, which likely influences small changes in morphology, both internal and external, and particle size distribution changes on a scale too small to reliably monitor. Other aspects, such as subtle changes in density profiles within pressed powder compacts, may be beyond the capability of current technology to assess. Crystal growth significant enough to affect the PETN particle size distribution is expected to impact detonator performance. (7) Factors relevant to stabilizing particle size growth include crystal morphology, powder surface area and particle size distribution; crystal density and internal defects; and powder compact density and density gradients.},

It describes the petrographical and mechanical properties of the granitoid rocks, different laboratory tests for mechanical properties and results, types and features of explosives, the parameters that intervene in blast designing and influence of blasting on rock aggregates. The rock mass properties greatly affect the blasting results and the quality of aggregates.

abstract = {Although Rock Mechanics addresses many of the rock mechanics issues which arise in underground mining engineering, it is not a text exclusively for mining applications. It consists of five categories of topics on the science and practice of rock engineering: basic engineering principles relevant to rock mechanics; mechanical properties of rock and rock masses; design of underground excavations in various rock mass conditions; mining methods and their implementation; and guidelines on rock mechanics practice. Throughout the text, and particularly in those sections concerned with excavation design and design of mining layouts, reference is made to computational methods of analysis of stress and displacement in a rock mass. The principles of various computational schemes, such as boundary element, finite element and distinct element methods, are considered. This new edition has been completely revised to reflect the notable innovations in mining engineering and the remarkable developments in the science of rock mechanics and the practice of rock engineering that have taken place over the last two decades. Based on extensive professional, research and teaching experience, this book will provide an authoritative and comprehensive text for final year undergraduates and commencing postgraduate students. For professional practitioners, not only will it be of interest to mining and geological engineers but also to civil engineers, structural and mining geologists and geophysicists as a standard work for professional reference purposes. B.H.G. Brady is Emeritus Professor and former Dean of the Faculty of Engineering, Computing and Mathematics at The University of Western Australia, and a consulting rock mechanics engineer. E.T.

@techreport{Duvall1962,
abstract = {In a review of some 40 papers on damage to residential structures resulting from blasting, only 3 were found that present data on the observed amplitude and frequency of the vibration levels produced by blasting together with an observed degree of damage to a residential structure. The data from these three reports have been analyzed statistically to determine if one of the quantities, displacement, velocity, or acceleration, is more reliable than the others for estimating the degree of damage to a residential structure. From this analysis the conclusion is drawn that a given degree of damage to a structure is most closely related to the magnitude of the particle velocity of the wave motion passing thru the earth at the structure location. On the aver- age, only minor damage is observed for peak particle velocities of 5.4 inches per second, and major damage is observed for peak particle velocities of 7.6 inches per second. When the spread of the data taken into consideration, the following statement can be made: Wave motions that have a peak particle velocity in excess of 2 inches per second have a fair probability of producing some damage to structures, whereas wave motions that have a peak velocity less than 2 inches per second have a very low probability of causing any damage. Therefore, the recommendation is made that vibration levels in the vicinity of residential structures should be maintained below a peak particle velocity of 2 inches per second. The above criterion for safe blasting is considered to hold over a wide variety of soil and rock conditions because the original data were obtained for a wide range of soil and rock conditions and on various types of residential structures},

abstract = {This paper discusses the development of a fiber optic probe that can obtain temperature measurements from the interior of explosive fireballs , which are generated when unreacted detonation products react with oxygen in the surrounding air . Signatures of the thermochemical environment and chemical species involved can often be deduced from their light emissions , but the limited optical depth of fireballs means that remote sensing techniques can only sample emissions from the outer shell . By developing a pro - tected fiber optic probe that can be placed adjacent to an exploding charge , giving it the ability to become enveloped by the fireball , the thermal radiation from the interior of the fireball can be sampled . Measurement from five shots using Detasheet - C explosives were carried out and could be obtained over the course of about 20 ms . Blackbody - type radia - tion with temperatures in the 1600 K to 1900 K range were observed , peaking at about 1850 K after 12 ms . The magnitude and time behavior of the temperature was not signifi - cantly different when taken at different locations within the fireball , indicating that tem - perature is fairly uniform throughout . The lack of specific spectral emission lines implies that in the interior of the fireball any combustion that occurred was probably primarily with carbonaceous soot , though differences in optical depth at different locations in the fireball indicate that it was much more fuel - rich closer to the center .},

@techreport{Schott2014,
abstract = {The lesson from gas detonation research in the last ten years is that the Chapman-Jouguet description of the detonation process, with its many refinements, is inadequate. The equilibrium properties of the reaction products of detonable gases can be calculated reliably, and the predictions of Chapman-Jouguet theory have been tested directly against experimental observations. Several kinds of experiments have revealed manifestations of the principal area of failure of the steady, one dimen- sional theory, namely the occurrence of significant transverse motions which, like the detonation itself, are sustained by energy from the ex- othermic chemical reaction. The characteristic form of the laterally propagating perturbations which accompany this motion is analogous to the Mach stern interaction of two dimensional flow. This particular structural form is seen to be developed most strikingly by fuel-oxygen systems which exhibit branching chain chemical kinetics, and relation- ships between the reaction course and the Mach stem structure and be- tween the structure and propagation failure limits in gases are indicated. The nonsteady process of initiation of detonation by a plane shock wave has also received attention, and one dimensional gas-dynamic computa- tions are able to account for this process fairly well. Nevertheless there are unmistakable indications of the appearance and growth of transverse perturbations in this process as well. Finally, the results of theoretical treatment of the question of stability of steady, one dimen- sional shock wave flow in the presence of exothermic reaction have in- dicated certain regimes of instability, and current computational explo- rations of possible manifestations of such instability include examinations of fluctuations of intensity of plane waves with time and of the kinematics of laterally propagating high frequency sonic disturbances in reactive one},

abstract = {A rational approach to dynamic features of closed combustion systems is of direct relevance to the interpretation of exothermic processes in enclosures, such as the cylinders of piston engines, as objects of control. For this purpose they have to be expressed in terms of non-linear dynamics. The paper presents a method developed in this respect on the basis of the principles of thermostatics and kinetics, supported by heat transfer. The dynamic stage of combustion, manifested by monotonic pressure augmentation, is then carved out of the whole by separating it from the initial stage of ignition and the final stage of decay. Formulated thereupon is an inverse problem: the determination of the dynamic properties of the exothermic process, in terms of the history of fuel consumption, from a measured pressure profile. Particularly instrumental in this respect are: (1) the life function expressing these variables in analytic form, and (2) the correlation, deduced from heat transfer studies, permitting the energy lost by heat transfer to the walls to be evaluated from pressure records. The implementation of the method is illustrated by a diagnosis of the effectiveness with which the exothermic process of combustion is executed in piston engines.},

abstract = {This paper presents a temperature evaluation method by means of high-speed, visible light digital camera visualization and its application to the mineral wool production process. The proposed method adequately resolves the temperature related requirements in mineral wool production and significantly improves the spatial and temporal resolution of measured temperature fields. Additionally, it is very cost effective in comparison with other non-contact temperature field measurement methods, such as the infrared thermometry. Using the proposed method for temperatures between 800 °C and 1500 °C, the available temperature measurement range is approximately 300 K with a single temperature calibration point and without the need for camera setting adjustments. In the case of a stationary black body, the proposed method is able to produce deviations of less than 5 K from the reference (thermocouple-measured) temperature in a measurement range within 100 K from the calibration temperature. The method was also tested by visualization of rotating melt film in the rock wool production process. Resulting temperature fields are characterized by a very good temporal and spatial resolution (18700 frames per second at 128x328 pixels and 8000 frames per second at 416x298 pixels).},

abstract = {The book is concerned with the effects of nonlinearity in feedback control systems and techniques which can be used to design feedback loops containing nonlinear elements. After a short introductory chapter on nonlinearity and its possible effects the use of phase plane methods for nonlinear second order systems is discussed. The next three chapters cover the describing function method and its applications in the determination of limit cycles, stability analysis and the prediction of unique nonlinear behaviour such as jump resonance and subharmonic generation. The following chapter shows using the Tsypkin approach how in feedback loops with a relay nonlinearity any limit cycles and their stability can be found exactly. Examples are given which cover some unique forms of limit cycles such as limit cycles with a sliding mode and multipulse limit cycles, which can be caused by resonant plant transfer functions. In recent years with the advent of microprocessor controllers there has been considerable interest in techniques for controller tuning based on limit cycle data and this is the topic covered in the next chapter. The analyses used make use of both the describing function method and the Tsypkin method presented in the previous chapters. The next topic covered is absolute stability methods for a nonlinear feedback loop with a single nonlinearity with emphasis placed on frequency domain methods to allow comparison with describing function results. The final chapter covers some methods for the design of nonlinear systems. The material is of an introductory nature but hopefully gives an overview and provides a basic understanding of various topics, many developed in recent years, and several of which have entire textbooks devoted to them.},

abstract = {Improvised explosive devices such as pipe bombs are prevalent due to the availability of materials and ease of construction. However, little is known about how these devices actually explode, as few attempts to characterize fragmentation patterns have been attempted. In this study, seven devices composed of various pipe materials (PVC, black steel, and galvanized steel) and two energetic fillers (Pyrodex and Alliant Red Dot) were initiated and the explosions captured using high-speed videography. The video footage was used to calculate fragment velocities, which were represented as particle velocity vector maps. In addition, the fragments were weighed. The results demonstrate a correlation between the type of energetic filler and both the size and velocity of the fragments. Larger fragments were produced by Pyrodex filler indicating a less complete fragmentation, compared with smaller fragments produced by double-base smokeless powder. Additionally, higher fragment velocities were seen with Alliant Red Dot filler.},

abstract = {As earthquakes are among the main triggers of slope failure, co-seismic landslides contribute significantly to earthquake damage in areas of large topographic relief. Topographic amplification is commonly implicated as a source of augmented ground motion in steep terrain. We performed a number of field experiments to constrain the seismic response of potential future rockslides. We conclude that rather than the shape of topography, amplification due to the internal structure of the instability is of primary importance. Specifically, we deployed small aperture seismic arrays to record ambient vibrations and earthquakes on unstable rock slopes in Swiss Alps. The recordings were analyzed by means of a high resolution f-k method, site-to-reference spectral ratios, and time-frequency dependent polarization analysis. The wavefield within the unstable rock mass was found to be dominated by normal modes of individual rock blocks rather than horizontal propagation of seismic waves. The observed amplification is strongly directional, and the maximum amplification is perpendicular to open cracks mapped on the surface. Polarization directions estimated from ambient seismic vibrations are in good agreement with the deformation directions obtained by geodetic and in-situ measurements. No such site effects were observed on stable part of the slopes.},

abstract = {Decades of explosive experimentation have repeatedly shown that measurements of airblast pressures from explosive events are subject to considerable statistical variation. Even in carefully crafted situations where measured airblast pressures should be identical (e.g., measurements at symmetric positions, measurements from separate tests of identical explosive charges, etc.), measured airblast parameters often exhibit substantial variability. This poses the experimentalist with at least two technical challenges: 1) quantifiably stating the uncertainty to be associated with the measured airblast parameters, and 2) determining best practice for minimizing these uncertainties and their propagation into predictive algorithms. Unfortunately, the cost and destructive nature of explosive testing often renders it impossible to perform sufficient replicate experiments to quantify these uncertainties in a statistically confident manner. Often, the uncertainties derived from single shot explosive events, or even those with a few replicate experiments, are so uncomfortably large as to render them not useful for drawing conclusions or bounding the output of predictive models based on the measurements.},

This study improves upon the traditional polynomial detrending method in order to correct the vibration acceleration signals with inconsistent initial velocity and displacement more rationally and efficiently. When numerical integration of recorded acceleration signals using assumed initial velocity and displacement values (which are generally inconsistent with real values) is performed, baseline shift or drift phenomenon can arise in velocity and displacement curves obtained. Baseline correction must be performed if an inconsistent acceleration signal is to be used in dynamic analyses. Polynomial detrending is generally used to remove unreasonable trends in time series, but the consistency among acceleration, velocity, and displacement has not received sufficient attention. The traditional polynomial detrending method is improved by purposefully removing the shifted trends in velocity and displacement. Two inconsistent vibration signals are selected to be corrected using both the traditional method and the improved method. It was found that the traditional method does not give a satisfactory correction result, but the improved method can correct the signal to be consistent. The improved detrending method is effective in making vibration signals have consistent acceleration, velocity, and displacement.},
