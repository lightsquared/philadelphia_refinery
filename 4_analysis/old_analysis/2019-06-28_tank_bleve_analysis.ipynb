    "# Introduction\n",
    "On June 21, 2019, an accidental fire and explosion occurred at the Girard Point Refinery owned by Philadelphia Energy Solutions[a](https://6abc.com/hydrocarbon-vapors-identified-as-cause-of-philly-refinery-fire/5368469/).  One of the three explosions observed was a storage tank weighing 74,000 lb containing 90,000 lb of iso-butane, propane, and hydrofluoric acid.  The tank was propelled approximately 2,000 ft from the blast seat.  The Philadelphia Fire Department requested ATF estimate the blast overpressure generated when the tank exploded.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is hypothesized that a boiling-liquid expanding-vapor explosion (BLEVE) event provided the energy to generate a blast wave.  This notebook is an engineering analysis to estimate the blast overpressure.  The analysis is based upon an adiabatic but irreversible energy analysis developed by Planas-Cuchi et.al [1].  \n",
    "\n",
    "# Background\n",
    "This analysis calculates the pressure of the blastwave generated from the BLEVE by finding the equivalent mass of TNT that would release the same amount of energy.  With the mass of TNT known, a pressure can be calculated using the Kingery-Bulmash equations.  The energy released from the BLEVE is calculated using the 1st Law of Thermodynamics assuming an adiabatic irreversible process.   \n",
    "## Boiling-Liquid Expanding-Vapor Explosion\n",
    "A BLEVE results from the sudden failure of a tank containing a compressed vapor (head space) and a super-heated liquid (a liquid heated above it's boiling point but without boiling). The magnitude of the blast depends on how super-heated the liquid was at failure.  As the level of super-heat rises, the portion of liquid that flash-boils rises, thus increasing the energy released.  Once containment failure occurs the energy is distributed into four forms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Overpressure wave\n",
    "2. Kinetic energy of fragments\n",
    "3. Deformation and failure of the containment material\n",
    "4. Heat transferred to environment\n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution of the energy into the these four forms depends on the specifics of the explosion.  Casal et al. found that a *fragile* failure releases 80% of the energy into the blastwave, while a *ductile* failure releases 40% of the energy into the blastwave.  The remaining energy becomes kinetic energy of the fragments.  The heat transfer to the environment is relatively small.[2]  In practice most pressure vessels are designed with materials that are ductile rather than brittle to avoid sudden and catastrophic brittle (fragile) failures [3].\n",
    "\n",
    "## First Law of Thermodynamics\n",
    "The 1st Law of Thermodynamics is a restatement of the conservation of energy (energy cannot be created or destroyed).  A way of stating the first law of thermodynamics is the internal energy $(\\Delta U)$ of a system is given by the sum of the heat $(Q)$ that flows into and out-of the system and the work $(W)$ done on the system:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta U = Q+W$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, there are only two ways to change the internal energy $\\Delta U$ of the system:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add or remove heat from the system, $Q$.\n",
    "- Perform or extract work from the system, $W$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is assumed for this analysis the BLEVE expansion of the super-heated liquid (initial state) to atmospheric conditions (final state) occurs so quickly there is no time for heat to be added or removed from the system.   When heat cannot be added or removed from a system it is called an adiabatic process.  During an adiabatic process the heat $(Q)$ is zero and the 1st Law of Thermodynamics can be rewritten to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta U = W$$\n",
    "## Work\n",
    "The work $W$ of an expanding gas is given by,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$W = P_0\\Delta V$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $P_0$ is the initial pressure and $\\Delta V$ is the difference in the final and initial volumes.  In the case of the BLEVE the change in volume is due to the conversion of the super-heated liquid to a gas.  We know the initial volume of the system, $V_i$ in this case, the tank volume.  However, the final volume, $V_f$, is an unknown.  We can however transform the final volume into terms we do know.  If we rewrite the final volume $(V_f)$ in terms of the specific volume (volume divided by mass) times the mass we can transform our change in final volume into a change in final mass,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta V =  V_f - V_i$$\n",
    "$$\\Delta V =  \\left(\\nu_Gm_G + \\nu_Lm_L \\right)_f - V_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$W = P_0\\left[\\left(\\nu_Gm_G + \\nu_Lm_L \\right)_f - V_i\\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The quality of a gas-liquid mixture is defined as the fraction of the total mass (gas + liquid) that is saturated vapor,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\chi = \\frac{m_G}{m_T}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $m_G$ is the mass of the gas and $m_T$ is the total mass.  Solving for the mass of the gas,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$m_G = m_T \\chi$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The mass of the liquid is then given by,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$m_T = m_G + m_L$$\n",
    "$$m_L = m_T - m_G$$\n",
    "$$m_L = m_T - m_T \\chi$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting equations (7) and (10) back into (5) we have,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$W = P_0\\left[\\left( \\nu_G m_T \\chi + \\nu_L(m_T - m_T \\chi) \\right)_f - V_i\\right]$$\n",
    "$$W = P_0\\left[\\left( \\nu_G m_T \\chi + \\nu_L m_T - \\nu_L m_T \\chi \\right)_f - V_i\\right]$$\n",
    "$$W = P_0\\left[\\left( \\left(\\nu_G - \\nu_L \\right) m_T \\chi + \\nu_L m_T \\right)_f - V_i\\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Internal Energy\n",
    "\n",
    "The internal energy is the energy of atomic motion.  It is the sum of the molecular kinetic and potential energies in a system (in our case, the tank filled with fluid).  The molecular kinetic energy is made up of three types of molecular motion:\n",
    "\n",
    "- translational, \n",
    "- rotational, and \n",
    "- vibrational.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The molecular potential energy is derived from the electromagnetic force that exists between the atoms in individual molecules and the intermolecular forces between molecules.  The internal energy is directly proportional to the temperature of the system (higher temperatures mean more internal energy and lower temperatures mean lower internal energy).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The change in internal energy can be changed similarly to how we change the volume in the Work section.  The change in internal energy can be rewritten in terms of the specific internal energy (internal energy divided by the mass) and the quality,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta U = U_f - U_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta U = \\left(u_Gm_G + u_Lm_L\\right)_f - U_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting equations (7) and (10) into the internal energy equation (15) we have,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta U = \\left(u_Gm_T\\chi + u_L(m_T - m_T \\chi)\\right)_f - U_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta U = \\left( u_G m_T \\chi + u_L m_T - u_L m_T \\chi \\right)_f - U_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta U = \\left( \\left(u_G - u_L \\right) m_T \\chi + u_L m_T \\right)_f - U_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Referring back to equation (3) and substituting equations (14) and (19) we can solve for the quality $\\chi$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\chi = \\frac{m_TP_0\\nu_L-V_iP_0+m_Tu_L-U_i}{\\left[(u_L-u_G)-(\\nu_G-\\nu_L)P_0 \\right]m_T}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "By substituting $\\chi$ back into equation (19) we can solve for the internal energy, $\\Delta U$.  Once we know the change in internal energy due to the flash-boiling we can calculate the equivalent weight of TNT that will produce the same change in internal energy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Conversion to TNT Equivalent Weight\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation for the conversion to equivalent TNT weight in kilograms is,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$W_{TNT} = \\beta\\: 0.2136 \\Delta U$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where: \n",
    "- $\\beta$ is the fraction of the energy released converted to the blast wave (fragile = 80% and ductile = 40%)\n",
    "- $0.2136\\frac{kg}{MJ}$ is the inverse of blast energy of TNT $\\left(4680\\:J/g_{TNT}\\right)$[4](https://books.google.com/books?id=Id15BgAAQBAJ&pg=PA2&lpg=PA2&dq=tnt+4680+J/g&source=bl&ots=qx-7s6EAHa&sig=ACfU3U1wcca5cWLX38lBoxDvvRqH0uaZ5g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiN2cDP1pHjAhWnm-AKHfBYCGkQ6AEwAHoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=tnt%204680%20J%2Fg&f=false)\n",
    "- $\\Delta U$ is the internal energy of the flash boiling liquid in $bar\\:m^3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the weight of TNT known it is a simple matter to calculate the overpressure at a specific distance from the BLEVE using the Kingery Bulmash equations [5].  "
