    "## Introduction\n",
    "On June 21, 2019, an accidental fire and explosion occurred at the Girard Point Refinery owned by Philadelphia Energy Solutions[a](https://6abc.com/hydrocarbon-vapors-identified-as-cause-of-philly-refinery-fire/5368469/).  One of the three explosions observed was a storage tank weighing 74,000 lb containing 90,000 lb of iso-butane, propane, and hydrofluoric acid.  The tank was propelled approximately 2,000 ft from the blast seat.  The Philadelphia Fire Department requested ATF estimate the blast overpressure generated when the tank exploded.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is hypothesized that a boiling-liquid expanding-vapor explosion (BLEVE) event provided the energy to generate a blast wave.  This notebook is an engineering analysis to estimate the blast overpressure.  The analysis is based upon an adiabatic but irreversible energy analysis developed by Planas-Cuchi et.al [1].  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "This analysis calculates the pressure of the blastwave generated from the BLEVE by finding the equivalent mass of TNT that would release the same amount of energy.  With the mass of TNT known, a pressure can be calculated using the Kingery-Bulmash equations.  The energy released from the BLEVE is calculated using the 1st Law of Thermodynamics assuming an adiabatic irreversible process.   \n",
    "### Boiling-Liquid Expanding-Vapor Explosion\n",
    "A BLEVE results from the sudden failure of a tank containing a compressed vapor (head space) and a super-heated liquid (a liquid heated above it's boiling point but without boiling). The magnitude of the blast depends on how super-heated the liquid was at failure.  As the level of super-heat rises, the portion of liquid that flash-boils rises, thus increasing the energy released.  Once containment failure occurs the energy is distributed into four forms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Overpressure wave\n",
    "2. Kinetic energy of fragments\n",
    "3. Deformation and failure of the containment material\n",
    "4. Heat transferred to environment\n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution of the energy into the these four forms depends on the specifics of the explosion.  Casal et al. found that a *fragile* failure releases 80% of the energy into the blastwave, while a *ductile* failure releases 40% of the energy into the blastwave.  The remaining energy becomes kinetic energy of the fragments.  The heat transfer to the environment is relatively small.[2]  In practice most pressure vessels are designed with materials that are ductile rather than brittle to avoid sudden and catastrophic brittle (fragile) failures [3].\n",
    "\n",
    "### First Law of Thermodynamics\n",
    "The 1st Law of Thermodynamics is a restatement of the conservation of energy (energy cannot be created or destroyed).  A way of stating the first law of thermodynamics is the internal energy $(\\Delta U)$ of a system is given by the sum of the heat $(Q)$ that flows into and out-of the system and the work $(W)$ done on the system:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\Delta U = Q+W\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, there are only two ways to change the internal energy $\\Delta U$ of the system:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add or remove heat from the system, $Q$.\n",
    "- Perform or extract work from the system, $W$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is assumed for this analysis the BLEVE expansion of the super-heated liquid (initial state) to atmospheric conditions (final state) occurs so quickly there is no time for heat to be added or removed from the system.   When heat cannot be added or removed from a system it is called an adiabatic process.  During an adiabatic process the heat $(Q)$ is zero and the 1st Law of Thermodynamics can be rewritten to:\n",

In the case of the BLEVE the change in volume is due to the conversion of the super-heated liquid to a gas.  We know the initial volume of the system, $V_i$ in this case, the tank volume.  However, the final volume, $V_f$, is an unknown.  We can however transform the final volume into terms we do know.  If we rewrite the final volume $(V_f)$ in terms of the specific volume (volume divided by mass) times the mass we can transform our change in final volume into a change in final mass,\n",
